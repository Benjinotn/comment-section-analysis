He's not conversing. He's speechifying. His behavior after 4:30 only supports this. Peterson is someone who has said he refuses to quote Marx because that is somehow dangerous. This is not an authentic intellectual. His stuffing Marx into a box with Stalin is pitiful, but symptomatic.",2021-10-24T02:12:32Z,0,

Heroineburgh,"We have to disagree HIGHLY with Peterson's assessment that ""masculine"" traits are also being suppressed in females. Many female characters in movies, TV shows, comics and video games have been DE-FEMINIZED, which means their masculine traits are being EMPHASIZED, not suppressed. Not sure why Peterson doesn't know this (maybe he isn't paying attention) or why Russell doesn't push back against Peterson's false assertion (maybe Russell isn't paying attention to pop culture either??). And furthermore, the evidence for this masculinization phenomenon (and the socialcultural commentary related to it) is ALL OVER YOUTUBE, so there's not far to go to notice it - it's right in front of your face.",2021-07-23T13:32:41Z,2,

paul stuart,"There is a spectrum of masculine & feminine traits in both sexes. It is enforcing certain characteristics on each that creates inner conflict. Maternal overprotection is no worse than disinterest or abuse. Peterson should know that gender change is a result of the need to conform to stereotypes, over 90% of male gender reassignments (the most common) are performed on those who worked in highly masculine jobs as a disguise. If the world stopped trying to homogenise gender expectation it would probably cease to be an issue. When female movie stars began wearing trousers there was little reaction & it is now unquestioned. If a man wears a dress it is an abnormal expression of masculinity, this shows a huge disparity of gender freedom. Both masculine & feminine traits (which have an overlap) can be toxic, that is the desire to assert yourself over another. All of these issues are all bound up in the dogma of religion - you should be what we tell you to be - & has spread into various forms of indoctrination. Religion remains an integral part of our society, it has served humanity badly on every level.",2022-05-19T14:32:52Z,0,0

Zack Mire,"Whether you agree or disagree with me as long as you are tolerant. As a young man born in 1998 from Lakemba, New South Wales, Australia in my honest opinion masculinity means courage and protection. True masculinity is all about standing up against bigotry, bullying, sexual assault, violence and other negative threats in our society to have empathy for others who are in danger or harassed. That is why I used the two words ‘courage’ having the bravery to stand up against evil and ‘protection’ by protecting innocent people who are bullied from evil. We as a society obviously need healthy positive masculinity period. Here are three video links below of three selfless men who saved innocent people from danger:

steppahouse,"Rising respect for RB in recent months, both as an interviewer and his obvious interest in parsing through our complicated civ. Here, though, he's overthinking it. While I agree with Peterson's comment that RB's hypothesis warrants thought, there's a simpler explanation. For Boomers especially, and carried over into Xrs, the prevailing assumption by the ad market decision-makers has been that regardless that a household only have one income and it was brought in by the man, the woman still made most of the day to day purchasing decisions, was assumed to use most of the products more often. After spending a couple of decades with that template, and as commercials became more sophisticated, were got more humor. Men have typically been the comic foils in mass media (though there are notable exceptions). However, even in the 90's, maybe due to something like Simpsonifocation or AlBundying, lol, we started seeing a LOT of the boyfriend/husband/father as the oaf, idiot, simpleton.

Lorna Long,"For some 20 years I was a single mother and breadwinner and found myself having to 'do battle' with many people and circumstances in order to be both mother and provide for my 2 daughters.

My friends at the time, being quite esoteric folks, told me I was 'too masculine' . That I needed to work on being 'more feminine'.

My point of view was that when you need to do battle, probably a war negotiation or a battle axe is going to serve me better than whatever 'more feminine' means.

Now that my daughters are adults, independent and professionals in their own careers, my friends comment on not 'knowing how I did it'  (balancing career, motherhood, children with learning disorders, multiple therapists, teachers who did not understand and an acrimonious ex-husband, various legal battles he threw at me, financing all the extra therapies plus everything 2 young people in today's world need - for all of 2 decades). The answer is 'I had to go Viking' on it all.

My daughters were unhappy when I was clearly not 'as available' as they would have liked growing up. But I made sure we had plenty of family times and time out together in nature in the little leisure time we had.

Now they understand the example and picture I gave them.  They are fully able to embrace both masculine & feminine sides to their humanness - the workplace and potential partners are NOT particularly ready for that though.

They are just not your average women. They have fully embraced their 'masculine' side with being definitely women who mean business in today's world. At home, (metaphorically speaking) they are definitely not used to giving up the remote. We never had that issue in a 3-woman household.

Embracing both sides is just not comfortable for women. There is still enormous stereotyping working against women being ""allowed"" to be that. Women are frequently 'punished severely' - at home, in social groups and even quite definitively in the workplace where equality of competence should be most of tolerated.",2022-01-09T15:54:07Z,0,0

Knowledge is Power,"It was a bit 'car crash tv' but there was a programme a while back called 'Young, Dumb and Living with Mum' which stuck a group of 18 yr olds in a house together and monitored them.  Most (all?) were coming from homes where their parents were in despair over their Childs' 'laziness' or inability to cope with the most basic tasks.  It was truly shocking to see 18yr olds asking for advice on how to heat up a tin of beans or turn on a washing machine. It suggested the kind of parenting Jordan speaks of here.   I don't want to point fingers - people can slip into habits, or make a simple mistake that just snowballs - but really if a child from a supposedly stable home is reaching 18 with no idea how to make a meal for itself or wash its own clothes the parents have to take a look at themselves!  You are not helping your children by smothering them with care and leaving them unable to take care of themselves (even if you're rich and think you'll always be able to pay someone to do things for you, you should still know how to take care of essential needs.

The same thing can happen in women then, when they've had trauma from men and feel like they aren't protected by men and can't be comfortable in their femininity around them.

Mark Fennell,"Masculinity does not negate femininity. It is catalysed by femininity. The submissiveness of feminity is active, and primary with regard to agency. However, femininity uncoupled from maternalism becomes an exercise in pointlessness, exploited by the social engineers to destroy masculinity. The strategy of saturating the public arena with sensationalised female sexuality, while simultaneously pathologizing the natural masculine response to it is derived from Pavlovs experiments in which he manufactured neurosis in dogs by simultaneously issuing excitory and inhibitory commands, throwing a stick and at the same time saying stay.

""The possible relevance of these experiments to sudden religious and political conversion should be obvious even to the most sceptical: Pavlov has shown by repeated and repeatable experiment just how a dog, like a man, can be conditioned to hate what it previously loved, and love what it previously hated. Similarly, one set of behaviour patterns in man can be temporarily replaced by another that altogether contradicts it; not by persuasive indoctrination alone, but also by imposing intolerable strains on a normally functioning brain.""

These ""tough"" modern men would not survive in the wild without some gun because they think that thriving is about surviving...almost as if they have forgotten or are unaware of gardening and self sustainability...That's not really ""tough"" stuff and it takes more than sheer force to go from surviving to thriving.

I swear people just pick something that sounds catchy but don't really reflect deep enough on these things.

Aristotle once said....
""Whosoever is delighted in solitude is either a wild beast...or a god...""

Many of us do delight in solitude...in any kinds of changing times...guess that makes us beast gods/goddesses.

So I guess this also means that peoples linear concepts of hard times and good times is a limiting belief aka a brule.
 
Score 9000 to the people surpassing these human made brules meant to divide humanity. Our love is stronger than the perceived divisive biases created by what is clearly emotionally hurt men who dont seem to realize that their problems isn't another human, but a currently evolving economic system that geniusly has enslaved the people.

Thankfully...even that is changing and the people and even animals are uniting against these unholy men and women or beings hell bent on delusions of control, power, imagined self importance, greed, temporary constructs that are inevitably impermanent.

Jan Vyachaslav,"​@Collan Everyone is different, yes, and you should pursue what you want in life, but the fact that you don't have to fight and protect yourself and the fact that you don't need to be physically and mentally strong to survive is because there are other people doing it for you.
The fact that you can be ""feminine"" and only express that part into the world is a comfort that comes from the effort of other people that do what you don't do or refuse to do. This is fine, but never pretend that this should be the norm and men should be like that all the time.

Let’s not kid ourselves it’s rape.

In regards to the feminine being most commonly used to sell a product or an idea is for me is that the masculine is widely being presented as toxic and maleness is an oppressive bad thing so we now see masculine products being sold by females who are perceived as good and giving the feminine ok to this product.  Just look at the Gillette Razor adverts that blatantly denounce masculinity while trying to sell products to men.  Women are now the only ones that can be trusted to promote male products as a male selling the same product or idea would be attacked as being toxic or untrustworthy.
This is also why it’s women are trusted to defend men’s rights and speak up on behalf of men as men defending themselves is also attacked by the anti male community as toxic.
This also I think accounts for so many young impressionable boys that don’t want to be men when they grow up due to the social vilification of men and maleness by the overwhelmingly female education systems.",2021-08-05T12:29:37Z,0,0

Furthermore, their is a massive difference between a heavy man that eats a huge amount of food and a lean man that small amount of food.

Marjut Paech,"We are the result of our own life experiences. It's done, when the mobile phone replaces parents ... then things go wrong!

It was not so long ago that an engineer told me he did not like Emancipated women. Is it related to the man's masculinity?

I myself thrive best in the company of men than to talk about, for example, women's things such as reading gossip newspapers, cleaning, washing dishes, etc. And even if I am purity myself and live a healthy life. Very boring topics that do not inspire my brain at all. It's just as boring to talk about money too. Zzz .... !!

How does the following proverb relate to masculinity or is it about contempt for women, where it considers the woman to be less worthy than the man?

Emancipated women do not need to emancipate themselves. They are not as good as men?

The whole emancipation rumor has not changed that women make themselves beautiful to please men? 

The preference of men for full beard is linked to the emancipation of women. Because even the most emancipated woman does not come with the full beard?""

And finally: why do men around the world abuse and murder ... women? What is the purpose of it?

Do not misinterpret me. I like men, but not those who treat women badly. They have no place in my life at all. I could never be with a man who abuses women to feel masculine.",2021-07-29T18:04:20Z,0,0

Yvonne Jensen,"The expression of females in consumerism as an extension or act of worship is hogwash. The commercialization of women is more often than not, limited to child looking women who have no resonance of a woman or her body. The societal expectations for young girls are reflected on this false narrative and impact the psyche of the young woman. The disconnected imagery starts an act of self hatred in young women. The most common imagery is exploited women who malnourish their bodies and subject themselves to sexual abuse from wealthy men. Instead of ""commercializing"" smart women who are attractive regardless of size  the focus is on a few wealthy men's image of beauty which is teenager they can control or tell what to do.

We each represent a type of zenith in distinct realms and each realm holds a key that prevents any one from dominating another, and when each key is achieved, each realm knows why dominance isn't to be desired.

J K,"Learning at the majority of YouTube viewers are male makes a lot more sense based on how the majority of the media I consume on this platform tends to not even recognize that women are just people! Have we come to consider that maybe the whole thing is a spectrum and that masculine versus feminine is just another part of the patriarchy, like Russell says, that masculinity is synonymous with power? And how about that, that sex work is illegal and yet a woman can be hired to represent a company in a certain way to convey the emotion that the soulless economy wishes it could represent? Please wake up and realize we're all just humans in meat sacks who don't have the right to judge any-body! Thank you Russell, when the time comes I would love to have you help found a religion (that is not a religion, just considered a ""religion"" for the sake of economic and lawful reasons in this broken country that doesn't value individuals and bodily autonomy without something written in the ""law""  to say that some ""god""  will smite them if they don't allow the ""religious"" to not get a vaccine or it's only work a certain amount of hours per week...) The system itself needs to stop being upheld. So thank you very much, Russell.

Bob Nevels,"Or maybe the commodification in consumerism makes the light available to allow men to embody the feminine independently of having access to a spouse. Women taught me that it's more important to build my own world through consumerism than to be attached to the feminine by need of the feminine. Consumerism actually would make it possible to mitigate and make prostitution less a thing. If a man can own his own spiritual sexuality then women wouldn't have that debt to men, which actually liberates women.

Basically men can't respect women unless they don't need women. And the sad thing is women had been conditioned to believe that being needed and being respected are the same thing, and they're not, which is why women have had a tendency to oppress themselves to show how needed they are, and that's how women held themselves back, because of confusing need with respect. Respect is more secure than need. But women have seemed to have been taught that if she is needed then she is secure, and that's a logical fallacy. Because need created neediness in men that created spiritual poverty in men that created an abusive relationship of some males relationship to women, that women themselves had created in part. I say in part not to blame, because women had been victimized to some degree, but identifying as a victim means that a woman's pride as victim is what keeps a woman a spiritual prisoner, and the good news of that is that a woman can just walk out of that prison at will.

In my private life I've sometimes been hard on the female perspective in relating the traps of some women to men, but my point with that is it doesn't matter what who did to who, be strong and protect yourself and it's better for all involved to dismiss victim narratives, because those narratives often had the argument that because this or that group had been hurt that you should just let yourself be hurt, and that's just fucking stupid. That's not natural. There's something animalistic and righteous in dismissing the past and respecting ones own humanity. Then human decency has a blank slate. And that's something only individuals can give themselves.

The logical fallacy of the Koran though as interpreted by some is that it's logically impossible to make the world into a world wide caliphate, because that assumed that Gods work with everyone else was a mistake that needed to be erased and that's arrogant that directly contradicts the best value of Middle Eastern culture, which is humility. Humility implies a willingness to learn listen and grow with other human beings, not control or.dominate other human beings. White people have had a past. The best wisdom of white culture is that light shines naturally when home is honored and not earned. Cherished. White history and past racism had contradicted that value, but that doesn't mean that value isn't there, because it is. Simplifying value of the family makes great cultural achievements. Versailles and several other shameless over expensive buildings weren't built for the sake of oppression. The spiritual debt there was there and couldn't not be there. Part of the tragedy of human history, but using that temporary moment of injustice to make something beautiful is one step of grace to eliminate injustice. 

Black culture is one of strength and resilience. Shaka Zulu created a mythology of warriors who could walk anywhere because their feet had no shoes. But that same formlessness led to an arrogance that seemed to confuse strength with valuing nothing. One strong black man once said love was a weakness. And that's wrong. But I also listened to his insights. Love needs to incorporate business sense or love is weak. That was me being willing to listen and respect black insight to strengthen my relationship with my own cultural insight about home and the clarity that inevitability brings and the sense of humility and willingness to fearlessly learn from someone else that would possibly be the best form of middle eastern culture. 

Courage is something all cultures share.

To prevent catastrophe I'm the anomaly in white culture. My wisdom has had a natural prince of darkness quality, and as a cultural exchange in the nineteenth century I traveled to Africa and functioned as a priest with Shaka Zulu for future mutual benefit.

We created a common mind of mutual wisdom. Thats what happened.",2021-07-28T15:05:41Z,0,0

GS 2019.,"Russell…..I can’t tell you how much watching your videos assist me in managing my own thoughts.  You are bringing almost every imaginable topic to the table.  Your last video with Jordan really helped me in an area I was struggling with. It was emotionally disturbing to me. In a very positive manner.  How to be moral and also not cast it aside in my employment.  When Jordan mentioned how much more reward do you need than knowing someone has benefited from something you shared.  That was the goal to help, correct? You try but you don’t know and than you found it helped someone profoundly.  That would be surprising and very humbling.  Very.  I don’t go to church often and I have even found myself questioning religion. However…I can not imagine Jesus as he has been described, not being his most pleased by a person simply helping someone else and genuinely caring. That is simple but…it’s most true.  Thank you for caring and providing so much thought provoking commentary.  What a person you have become. Another trait that would be admired by a kind and loving higher being…selfless.  I am attempting to improve.  Thanks for the content to help in this.  I want you to know that I am truly grateful.",2021-07-26T00:48:16Z,1,0

Black Bordello,"This is such an archaic reading of gender symbols in culture. Yes the devouring mother is one archetype, the overbearing overprotective figure who needs to mollycoddle their children in order to have a sense of purpose, for without them they are gone. But gender has changed massively in the turn of the century because the archetype of the overarching, omniscient, omnipotent father has gone. Rarely does this archetype exist in a family anymore. In fact what we have now is a dislocation in the way men are taught to be providers, defenders and strategists but they are not routinely sent out to war anymore and taught to fight. In fact, the lines between hormonal makeup of both sexes are blurring, hence paving the way for less paradoxical and concrete definitions of either. This is by cause of nature, as a result of nurture. The time when these biblical and Victorian fables were written were times when men had a great weight of demands and responsibility which society does not demand of them as much anymore - before then and in more collectivist societies, women were routinely seen as power figures and the bodies were worshipped beyond commodification, eg Kali goddess of War, Athena, etc. Also, the body would respond hormonally to a man who went to war, producing more fight hormones, whereas now a man sitting at a desk would not need as high a production level of the fight hormones. This poses greater freedom to all genders when deciphering themselves as autonomous beings, now somewhat less defined by the parts between their legs but subject to environments and, most importantly, their choices.",2021-07-24T15:19:35Z,0,0

Martini,"Sometimes i think that power and humiliation is a human need it's just not in the mazlow pyramid. It would be on the bottom. We basically live in a Mass Psychosis with a primitive Intuition/Unconscious and a overly positive persona. Carl Jung said something like ""the biggest threat of mankind is a mass psychosis"" which i think we live in right now. I mean for example we never got teached in school about dominance hierarchies or how to go through live without depression and anxiety. It's like no one ever wants you to be a confident, strong human, not your teachers, not your parents, no one. So we live in a hammer and nails 'society' right? So there is per definition always a winner and a loser. And if you're a loser lets say you get depressed, do drugs and suicide its totally wanted by everyone around you. So it's absolutely no wonder that these things are on the rise. Absolutely no wonder :)",2021-07-24T10:32:50Z,0,0

Silvia,"I am a woman and I’ve lived a very difficult life so as a result of that I had to develop a lot of masculinity but right now I am in a beautiful space in my life where I am finally mostly in my feminine energy and can switch on my masculine when I see necessary. 

My boyfriend also had a difficult upbringing but that has made him very loving and sweet but lost touch with his ‘get go’ mode. It was many difficult conversations to make him see that masculinity is not being expressed, I am stressed at times because he’s so chilled out and I take on way too much responsibility like I said he’s the sweetest boy in the world and would do anything for me so he’s realising it slowly. I feel so blessed to live my life with him ♥️",2021-07-24T08:33:49Z,3,2

To the original comment, though, I do think there is a lot of value to that childlike spirit especially bc I think most men have it, but we obviously suppress it in a variety of ways and for many reasons lol. I'm kinda immature so the urge of seeking approval and etc occurs to me a lot, no matter how subtle.

U A,"I  agree with most things in this discussion , I would also bring into question about most Italian mothers and their relationship with their sons, as well as cultures where it is the norm to live in extended families, married sons with their wives and mother's etc and for many it works.
I believe there should be a balance with attachment, in all relevant relationships.
Having said this, my own relationship with my mother can be likened to one of the worst examples   of narcissistic and sadistic parental abuse.

s f,"@U A It's cool, realised I'd been surrounded by narcissistic people my whole life too. Anyway understanding the manipulations is vital, because then you start to label it...like say to yourself oooh there's a bit of shaming with a good dose of guilt tripping, oh another character assination, look at that they're triangulating me again, I see, here comes the love-bombing again, trying to buy me now with their offer of money, look there goes the future faking with the promise of a trip or whatever. I see they're complimenting me now ( it's not genuine) so I know they're about to ask for something from me now. Oh they're now mirroring me to persuade me to do something. Notice the triangulation, it's a favourite of the narcissist, oh I see they're projecting onto me ( they can't look inside themselves ) here comes the blameshifting, a bit of contrition, mmm using intimidation now to keep me in line etc...Once you label and recognise the way that person makes you feel and label the behaviour then you start to realise the game they're playing and that you can better deal with it because you can see things clearly. Eventually whether family or not you'll come to the conclusion that you're better off keeping a distance between yourself and the manipulator regardless of the loyalty to the parental or intimate relationship. I think the gas lighting is the worse! However with that said, nearly everyone manipulates for good or bad, so it's important to recognise our own manipulative behaviours too, especially when it's been modelled to us from childhood. It's not about demonising a person but more about our own self-protection and emotional growth and maturity.
A good book to read is 'Manipulation'  by H.G Tudor, there's plenty more but that combined with 'Escape' are really insightful books.

At least because you understand the dynamics you can strive to change it for the future generations in your ancestral line. With healthy balanced relationships extended family and community plays such a role in thriving. Unfortunately many of us don't have it so we're locked into all sorts of manipulations.

My, Dad, and Mom- are, Richard Burton, and, Elizabeth Taylor. My Destiny, is to be, a famous, British actress, and, Queen, of the, United Kingdom. To date, I figured out that, Henry Cavill (Age: 38. He is the famous, British actor, who plays, Superman. He played, Superman, in, “Man of Steel,” which came out in the year, 2013), Tom Ellis (Age: 42.

He, is, the, famous, Hollywood American, actor- famous, for the movie, “Singin’ in the Rain,” and, “An American in Paris.” Gene- died, too soon- for us to be- Husband, and Wife. Gene- will reincarnate, and he will, be, Gene Kelly- all over, again! His name will, be- Gene Kelly, again. Carey Grant, Tony Curtis, and Robert Montgomery, will be my, Husbands-too. That means, all 9 of us, have it in our, Destiny, to be the, Kings, and Queen, of the, United Kingdom. Gosh, I’ve been trying to figure out, which famous, White actor, was my Husband (or, Husbands), since the year, 2011, or so. :D HAHAHA! So now, I’ll be traveling, back, to the, United Kingdom, from Fullerton, C.A. (Fullerton, C.A., is in the, Country, of, the United States, within the, County, of, Orange.). My, Son, Reign Aston Disick, who is, 6 years old, and born in the year, 2014 (he is popular for the show, “Keeping Up with the Kardashians”. He was, Scott Disick, and Kourtney Kardashians, Son.), will be joining us, in the, United Kingdom, as well. I went to the, United Kingdom, in 2020, during the, Global Pandemic. FACT (I’ve known the, Global Pandemic, was fake, since, it began. FACT). Now that I, know, who my, Husbands- are, I can travel, back, to the, United Kingdom- for a final time- and meet, and Marry them. I will be, meeting them, in the Borough of, Essex. YAY, for me :D ! I have, 9, Hot Husbands. I’m so excited! They are, super sexy: beautiful, fun, wild party guys, intense, confident, cocky, and genius, Celebrity. I am lucky. I know (already), that they will, value, Monarchy, and Tradition, just as much as, I do, by the time I finally meet them, in person. They better <3! Laugh out Loud. They’re my dream, Men. Tom Ellis, has 3 Daughters, they are named, Nora, Florence, and Marnie. So, they are my, Daughters! I have 3, Daughters, and one, Son- already, how wonderful, to know! They have been making me, so, proud :D . I made them this way. Their ages range, from 6 to 19. I, HATE, their current, Stepmom, Meghan Oppenheimer. She is, not, good for them. She has been, a bad person, and ugly, inside, and out, her whole, life. She is a, Nerd. She is, young, in her, 30’s, like me, and a, Classic Nerd. She is a, gawker (Defined: to stare, stupidly; gape. An awkward, foolish, person. peer, ogle, gaze, goggle, rubberneck). She stares, too hard. I am, Cool. I have always, been, cool, popular, super social, well loved, and loving- outgoing, and a, crazy, truly wild, party girl. I am a, Hippie. The type of, Hippie- I am, is, Raver. I am a, Raver. We partied, hard, in my 20’s! We still party, hard, in various places. It’s, awesome! We are, awesome! HAHAHAHA! I, AM, WHITE. I am, a, Traditional, White American, Female- from the, Deep South. My skin, is, light brown, so you can tell, that I am, a part, of the, Black, African American, community. However, I, AM, WHITE. WHITE, people, are, My people. They are my people. I am, White. That means, I am, NOT, a, Negro. I am not a, Negro. So, do not, pretend, that I am, Black, or a, Negro; Ever. If you do, you will not survive, this life. My story, is very interesting, so far, isn’t it? And, I still, haven’t even gotten out into the world! I haven’t even met, my Husbands, yet? What the heck, World? Beginning, in the year, 2000, Human Society, itself, has been, disobedient, disoriented- in disarray, and purposeless. That is why, I have not been, able, to live out my, Human Destiny. I, AM, happy- that I have the money, and the ability- as a, Middle class, Average, American Citizen. WITH FATHER GOD, JESUS CHRIST, AND THE HOLY SPIRIT- AND THE FULL BODY, OF MY, RELIGION, AT THE HELM- WE, ARE THE ONES, BRAVE ENOUGH, TO MAKE THIS, HUMAN WORLD (Revelations): TRADITIONAL, NORMAL, PLEASING, AND BEAUTIFUL, AGAIN! MONARCHY! The answer, all along, was, MONARCHY! All other, Humans, may join me, as well :) . I will see you guys out there! My life plan, is currently, in progress. I’ll be home, soon! At the, White Top! I will not rush. I’m taking my time. This will be my, final voyage, so it has to go, perfectly, one time.

When capitalism gets out of control, it causes communism to happen. I'm not endorsing either system- I'm just explaining that one is caused by the other. Moreover, communist governments mostly kill people in their own countries, whereas capitalist governments have done it mostly in other people's countries. Stalin killed millions in Russia, Ukraine and Poland. Anti-communist Nazi Germany also killed millions in Russia, Ukraine and Poland. My dad walked over fields of corpses in Vietnam. We committed a genocide there because we said that they don't have the right to be communists, even in their own country.

junk can,"Peterson has provided a response to the Women's Lib./NOW/it's all men's fault movement of the last half century.  While there has been so much support and effort for women and minorities and so much blame for white men, it can be hard to see that for some white  men of Gen X, and increasing numbers of men in Gens Y and Z, there has been an uphill battle to find a niche or ""acceptable"" role to play in society at large.  Many fail to see how much of this is really an ECONOMIC struggle with the top 1% and the Oligarchs sucking so much out of the economy, that ""poor white men"" of today have enough of a hard time struggling like everyone else, let alone taking the  blame for the efforts of our forefathers.  I went to Berkeley.  TONS AND TONS of brilliant  students; HOWEVER, there was an almost toxic  attitude toward even healthy, dare I say, ideal, expectation that men must also advance in the global society.  This is also true with the increase of focus, belated though it is, for attention to the LGBTQXYZ, etc. segments of society who, until  recently, have been nearly invisible.  THOUGH I UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE THE NEED TO HAVE PAID ATTENTION AND INCREASED AWARENESS OF ALL THESE GROUPS, it can be kind of hard hearing for almost all of my life, close to 50 years, the men are bad and are responsible for all the ills of the world.  I am deeply relieved that someone like Dr. Peterson came to the rescue of the male agenda and am also deeply appreciative that someone as brilliant as Mr. Brand has  provided opportunities for his fans to be exposed to the ideas and responses of Dr. Peterson.",2021-07-23T20:34:15Z,0,0

Citizen 337,"Yes, the Tetragrammaton maps a Tetrahedron geometrically. If you have 3 points of a perfect Tetrahedron, the 4th point is implied mathematically and known. In the Name of God (aka the Tetragrammaton), there are four letters - Yod-Heh-Vau-Heh. Yod is the point of origin, and corresponds to the male. Heh is the space around the point of origin - geometrically expressed by the radius from the origin. This is why female is a vessel, the womb. You see this in reproductive geometry too - sperm are tiny, like the origin point and the egg is huge, like the sphere determined around the origin. Then you have Vau which means ""son, but is the repeat of the original male origin point, but is 90 degrees out of phase rotationally with the original origin point. The 4th point is Heh again, which is the female again - the consort of the Son, or the sister, as in Apollo and Athena. But that second female is implied not in to lower the female aspect, but simply because it is the 4th point geometrically. The 90 degree phase shift of the second pair of points is where spin comes from. You must have the male AND the female (1st two points) to have polarity, and you must have the second pair to get movement and spin. The 4th point is necessary, but is implied by the geometry of the first 3 points. The first 3 points correspond to the Holy Trinity.",2021-07-23T19:01:07Z,0,0

I think people forget about the Gentleman—someone who nearly serves a lady and is totally respectful while retaining his masculinity. He wants to provide and protect even if she could totally do it all of her own (duh). Men who abuse are abusers NOT masculine. A may equal B but B doesn’t necessarily equal A.

He was good to us kids, didn't get angry when he was involuntary put on kid swings or dressed up, for being such amazing rooster he had special privileges and all food he could wish for so he grew up in size of small turkey and had long life until he died of old age.

Christina,"In these discussions, the elimination of God and the Devil hinders the equation, which is what appears you are searching for. 
The equation is simple. God made man in an image of himself. Masculinity comes from God. Masculine men tend to be leaders. Women who are also leaders appear masculine. When it comes to the question of using women for advertising, discussed around the 4:30 mark, the solution is quite simple. The Devil is the prince of this world and he uses the 7 deadly sins of man to entice our minds and souls away from God. Using women for advertising satisfies LUST (men lusting over the women), ENVY (other women wanting to be like the models), GREED (companies benefiting from using the women), ANGER (triggering people out of peace and into anger which is a low vibrational energy) GLUTTONY (over consuming products in such excess that one does not need).

Two things to unpack: 1) that women still view men, at least in part, in terms of their earning/providing capacity, but also 2) how the idea to empower women became a zero-sum game in practice. 

College enrollments skew majority female today. Historically, women have married at an equal or higher economic level whereas men have traditionally married at an equal or lower level. That, of course, was before opportunities for women became more widespread. Fewer men in college means fewer at the equal/higher economic level, at least in a ""professional"" sense.

Of course there's a negative side, but without Alpha, there would have been no exploration, little innovation and less rapid development of mankind. There would be no heroes who led us forward, no firefighters, no defenders of Truth, no challengers to moral decay. Without Alpha there would be no Martin Luther King or Joan of Ark, no Neil Armstrong or Nelson Mandela. And, in the end, the real reason for compliance cannot be Alphas, since plenty of 'sheepish compliance' still exists without Alphas, as demonstrated most clearly by recent events.",2021-07-24T13:00:36Z,0,

katalin kiss,"How did a discussion about masculinity end up discussing the ""devouring mother"" myth? It has been easy to blame beleaguered  mothers when fathers have largely been absent due to the imperative to fulfil their ( largely constructed by establishment manipulation) societal ""masculine"" functions such as cannon fodder, wage slavery and striving to become the alpha male within the Malthusian/Social Darwinian landscape that is the Neo Liberal Economic Horror show we inhabit. We are animals that are Mammals first human beings (Homo sapiens) second and male female or somewhere on the continuum thirdly. We are a part of our environment not apart from our environment. That is what needs to be learnt by the hyper masculine structures we are forced to live under. Competition, domination, the cult of the narcissist are all manifestations of the priorities of a world out of balance and the danger of being out of balance is there will be a fall that will affect all",2021-07-23T10:34:37Z,0,0

GoatCreature,"""80% of YouTube users are male"" - Such a ludicrous, untrue statement. He is either speaking confidently out of ignorance or is wilfully lying. Either way, the words are coming straight from his ass.

Two of the largest sections of YouTube are childrens entertainment, which splits the genders in half, and makeup tutorials. Second to that are the Paul Brothers brand of ""entertainment"" which draws in overwhelmingly female audiences. Only gaming can be placed amongst the top wherein it swings overwhelmingly male.

YouTube's entire structure is female dominated. The Vlog Brothers were early on capturing a huge female audience, and they're the ones who made VidCon, the annual YouTube creator convention, which itself is attended mostly by females. The earliest large YouTubers tended to draw in overwhelmingly female audiences as well; Charlieissocoollike, Dan and Phil, Jeffree Star, Trisha Paytas, Jenna Marbles, and the list goes on. And more recently, The Paul Brothers and their ilk.

The reason Peterson's audience is 80% male is because he spends his days attempting to capture disaffected male youth like they're fucking pokémon. It's a part of his grift. To claim that his audiences are representative of YouTube as a whole is laughable and disingenuous; he himself has expressed confusion and concern as to why his audience is so male dominated, as was the case in a tweet on the 3rd of March 2017 at 7:37pm in which he said ""91% of those who view my videos are male. Why? Why few women?""

This new angle reeks to me of some kind of death rattle. An ostrich burying his head in the sand. To accept openly that his messaging only narrowly appeals to men because of its sexist undertones and the specificity of his content which is effectively just Alcoholics Anonymous self-help bullshit from the 1970s would be a deathblow to his ego, I feel.",2021-07-23T10:15:10Z,0,0

And anyway, any creator worthy of the name surely should never be anthropomorphised in this way. Tho I sorta like the image of Mary as Queen of Heaven, which means she must have a male counterpart.

The story is told to girls with the message: if you wait longer you might get a partner who is a greater catch. Its from the time when girls couldnt improve their own status or forfill their ambitions with their own career. It had to be via the man, so all you could do is stay there and look beautifull: ""sleeping beauty"" is about just that: objectified as beauty that is the only thing you can be: a body.

Abigail O'Rourke,"Peterson is saying problems arise when we don't invite in/make space for the Devouring Mother/crone/witch/feminine chaos/whatever you want to call it... i.e. Sleeping Beauty ends up unconscious.

Based on the myth he's referencing, if the Devouring Mother is a problem in our society, is this not evidence that something might be lacking...? An invitation, maybe? 🤔

Peterson spends his time advocating AGAINST the overmothering behaviors/archetype... Yeah dude, duh, Maleficent is powerful and vengeful and scary... We know! He also acknowledges the feminine has BOTH positive and negative arcs, i.e. Fairy Godmother and Evil Witch. 

So what would have happened if Sleeping Beauty's parents apologized to Maleficent and invited her to the next party?

What if we advocated FOR the Witch to be invited in the first place, so we don't spend the rest of the movie (aka our lives) fighting?

Oh right, because we LOVE the drama of it all! 😆 It wouldn't be a good movie if we didn't have a bad villain... 

In real life, if we want meaningful change we have to stop making villains out of each other. It seems to me Peterson would rather keep making his point ""overmothering is bad"" rather than thoughtfully engage with the Devouring Mother herself.

If I were having an intimate conversation with Peterson myself I would ask him, what if you actually LOVE being devisive and controversial? What if you truly enjoy getting strong reactions from people by belabouring emotional, difficult topics with evasive and academic language? What if you accepted you are really GOOD at doing just that? And what if that is a totally normal and amazing phenomenon, and what would happen if we observed it and savored it and used in a cooler, more effective way??? Why deny the drama???

Jeremiah Huckleberry,"I have to differ on this one point that Mr. Peterson makes: that most YouTube viewers are male. According to 'Statista' 72% of male Internet users in the US view YouTube at least once a day. This same stat goes for the female Internet audience, 72% of which view YouTube at least once a day, as of Q3 of 2020. Far from being a mostly male audience, these stats prove that YouTube is viewed just as much by females as by males.

the.dream.is.real,"In the Nag Hammadi library that was discovered a few decades ago, Early Christian Gnostic Gospels include codex where Jesus clearly explains the solution to climate change.  It's very simple. 

Essentially, the Elite, and/or the Elect, need to quit sinning so much. 
But after that, if that, Enoch explains there's only another 500 years left for this Aeon, at most.
From the gnostic book of Thomas the Contender-

The savior said, ""Brother Thomas while you have time in the world, listen to me, and I will reveal to you the things you have pondered in your mind.

""Now, since it has been said that you are my twin brother and true companion, examine yourself, and learn who you are, in what way you exist, and how you will come to be. Since you will be called my brother, it is not fitting that you be ignorant of yourself. And I know that you have understood, because you had already understood that I am the knowledge of the truth...

For he who has not known himself has known nothing, but he who has known himself has at the same time already achieved knowledge about the depth of the all. 

So then, you, my brother Thomas, have beheld what is obscure to men, that is, what they ignorantly stumble against."" ....

Jesus said, ""It is in light that light exists.""

Thomas, spoke, saying, ""Lord, why does this visible light that shines on behalf of men rise and set?""

(The Sun)

The savior said, ""O blessed Thomas, of course this visible light shines on your behalf -

 not in order that you remain here, but rather that you might come forth - 

--> and whenever all the elect abandon bestiality, <---
 then this light (the sun) will withdraw up to its essence, and its essence will welcome it, since it is a good servant.""

In other words, according to Jesus- 
the sun is a good and faithful servant, but this technological world teaches children to fear the sun. 

And about ""climate change""- The sun withdraws SOME of its light when the elect REDUCE bestiality-
The sun will withdraw ALL of its light when all of the Elect ABANDON bestiality, and then it's lights out. 

Pistis Sophia- ch 53: 22
(Mary Magdalene)

22- The Savior said, All Nature, all formations, all creatures exist in and with another, and they will be resolved again into their own roots. 
For the nature of matter is resolved into the roots of its own nature alone
He who has ears, let him hear.

25) Peter said to Him- Since you have explained everything to us, tell us this also- what is the sin of the world?
The Savior said, there is no sin, but it is you who make sin when you do the things that are like the nature of adultery, which is called sin. 

That is why the Good came into your midst, to the essence of every nature in order to restore it to it's root. 
That is why you become sick and die, for you are deprived of the one who can heal you. 
He who has a mind to understand, let him understand. 

30) Matter gave birth to a passion that has no equal, which proceeded from something contrary to nature. 

Then there arises a disturbance in its whole body.

31) That is why I said to you, Be of good courage, and if you are discouraged, be encouraged in the different forms of nature. 

He who has ears let him hear. ...

Go then, and preach the gospel of the Kingdom.
Do not lay down any rules beyond what I appointed you, and do not give a law like the lawgiver lest you be constrained by it. 
When He said this, He departed.""

DEFINITION Adultery-
   (All that)
Definition Adulterate:
  (Vaccines and GMOs)

So the Elite/ Elect must do less adultery, and then the sun withdraws some of its light.

Ram,"I feel like wome in adevrtisement are a natural manifestation of one and the same polarity where men and women are very much refined, somehow negative aspects of masculinity and femininity, with a man still being forced to be a powerful provider, someone who's awaited to grow up and prepare to facilitate the big move towards the responsible part of life where's no space for mistakes, while woman is somehow clingy, waiting and attracting the superficially right man (as far as her trauma allows to recognize), and being entitled to his attention.
Obviously, by the virtue of such relationship, woman is the half of it that's seen/shown in media. Man would be anxiously working behind the scenes, preoccupied with his daily tasks to feel worthy of such women.
Hopefully reality isn't as black and white.

Overall It's refreshing to hear someone speaking of masculine and feminine traits in BOTH, men and women. I would have liked to hear more of it and less blame from mouths of all the so called experts on mainstream talk shows during Metoo era.",2021-07-23T01:27:35Z,0,0

This has  sadly run headlong down the wrong road and hasnt improved the situation only driven a greater inherent issue. The statement that men and woman are more alike than different couldnt be more correct as in productive and long relationships it is an important factor that there be baseline shared factors that are in agreement and not in need of focus for the sake of individuality. Masculinity cant be defined on a single line as is now so often pushed as it isnt a set list of boxes to tick off in magazine but rather the combined outcome of many factors some of which cant be letter boxed or pigeon holed as we are so adept at doing in this age :),2021-07-23T00:30:38Z,0,0

""OPEN WIDE PANDORA'S BOX""
Open wide Pandora's box.
Journey to a culture where the Goddess reigns Supreme. 
Re-trace HERstory woven by the Matriarchs. 

Read to your daughters, Cinderella and Goldilocks, 
But preface them with the ""male-dominated"" machine,
So that we may open wide Pandora's box.

Worship of the Sun/Son demanded clocks,
Yet, in witches' eyes, the power gleams.
Re-joice in the rhythmic cycles of the Matriarchs. 

For the man who whistles, rapes, and stalks,
Help your sisters spin and spin their dreams, not scream.
We must open wide Pandora's box.

Like a paper hand that shadows rocks,
Silently, we gather and chant our ritual regime. 
Re-cite the wisdom of the Matriarchs. 

Dance on the graves of overbearing Patriarchs;
Dance in the midnight light of moonbeams. 
Re-embrace ourselves, our Matriarchs. 
Open wide Pandora's box.

Animal Farm,"Very few seem to appreciate that Peterson is a plutocrat funded right-wing fascist. Peterson's funding comes straight out of the Mont Pelerin Society members and Peterson's given task is similar to that of Margaret ""There is no such thing as society"" Thatcher who was dedicated to pushing Reagan's idea of ""The Individual"" and ""Government is the Problem"". Peterson is just cloaking ""Individualism"" in ""Masculinity"" to manipulate the rubes; pushing the idea that individuals shouldn't need help from anyone and they ""should be able stand on their own two feet"". This is a very useful mantra for the establishment when the plutocrats are demolishing and subsuming governments around the world and corporate taxes are becoming part of ancient history.  
Following Peterson may be rational if you're a right-wing fascist dedicated to continually pushing society into a Dickensian era where the elite pay no taxes and money-power rules, but why is Russell Brand continually pushing Peterson on his show? Could this “anti-Capitalist” Brand actually be Controlled Opposition for the establishment?",2021-07-22T22:44:42Z,0,0

Rubim Ellmelech,"The Principle of Gender:

""Gender is in everything; everything has its Masculine and Feminine Principles; Gender manifests on all planes.""--The Kybalion.

This Principle embodies the truth that there is GENDER manifested in everything--the Masculine and Feminine Principles ever at work. This is true not only of the Physical Plane, but of the Mental and even the Spiritual Planes. On the Physical Plane, the Principle manifests as SEX, on the higher planes it takes higher forms, but the Principle is ever the same. No creation, physical, mental or spiritual, is possible without this Principle. An understanding of its laws will throw light on many a subject that has perplexed the minds of men. The Principle of Gender works ever in the direction of generation, regeneration, and creation. Everything, and every person, contains the two Elements or Principles, or this great Principle, within it, him or her. Every Male thing has the Female Element also; every Female contains also the Male Principle. If you would understand the philosophy of Mental and Spiritual Creation, Generation, and Re-generation, you must understand and study this Hermetic Principle. It contains the solution of many mysteries of Life. We caution you that this Principle has no reference to the many base, pernicious and degrading lustful theories, teachings and practices, which are taught under fanciful titles, and which are a prostitution of the great natural principle of Gender. Such base revivals of the ancient infamous forms of Phallicism tend to ruin mind, body and soul, and the Hermetic Philosophy has ever sounded the warning note against these degraded teachings which tend toward lust, licentiousness, and perversion of Nature's principles. If you seek such teachings, you must go elsewhere for them--Hermeticism contains nothing for you along these lines. To the pure, all things are pure; to the base, all things are base.",2021-07-22T22:40:09Z,2,0

Bon Tempo,"It's simple.  The fake culture of the internet, has affected real life. And another bad thing about that, is that internet culture has alot of young generations running through it. Often, people are not even thinking about the age of who is making a comment.
And the problem with that is, young people honestly don't know shit yet lol.  We ALL think we did when we was that age, but once you've been around the block, you really get to see what it's all about.
 So back to my main point, why is it bad that fake internet culture has affected real life, because there is NOOO respect anymore. Respect was a social evolution. Respect is intelligent. Respect is a marker that life is understood and we understand natural thresholds based on consequences and what is worthwhile. It's long sighted, it's healthy, it makes life better, easier, safer.
And respect has totally gone. Nobody respects anyone or anything anymore !! So suddenly, all our structures are taken away, and we are left to react like animals in defence of our humiliation, attacks, safety, pride, ego, etc.  It's basically social anarchy.  It's people saying 'fuck them, fuck that, i'll do what i want' - read that like a stroppy teenager, and it will help you see how immature that mentality is. And of course it's immature, because it came from the young generations.
Without respect, we attack each other. We cross lines. We push deep into each other. We destroy structures of masculinity and femininity and replace it with the current mess that makes people feel like the world is ending, or at least this civilisation.",2021-07-22T22:29:49Z,0,0

the.dream.is.real,"The Christian ""Trinity"" is missing the ""Quartile"" because it was removed by the Roman Patriarchy from the early Christian texts!

From the Gosp of Thomas-
114. Simon Peter said to them, ""Make Mary leave us, for females don't deserve life.""
Jesus said, ""Look, I will guide her to make her male, so that she too may become a living spirit resembling you males. For every female who makes herself male will enter the kingdom of Heaven.""

""Blessed is he who has seen himself as a fourth one in heaven.""

Starting with the Trinity, and the Missing In the Holy Family-
1) Joseph
2) Mary
3) Jesus
Who is missing? 
4) Mary, His companion

Gosp of Philip-
Jesus walked with three Marys-
Mary, His mother, 
Mary, his companion, 
Mary, his sister
1) Joseph
2) Mary
3) Jesus
Who is missing?
4) Mary, His sister- a NATURAL WOMAN. 

This has been a patriarchal world of fighting between brothers long enough.
Children of Adam and Eve-
1) Cain
2) Abel
Who is missing? 
3) Seth- his consciousness is ""out there""
4) Norea- a ten year old virgin with a firey spirit. When Noah built the Ark, she wanted on board, but Noah refused. So she burned it down and he had to build another one.  She has something to say and  refused to be left behind.  She also FOUGHT OFF powerful male archons with designs to rape her.

1) Christ the primal aeon with Harmozel, and the invisible spirit gave him unconquerable intellectual power
2) His child Seth with the second light Oroiael
3) The seed of Seth with the souls of saints who forever dwell with Daveithe....
And n the position of the Fourth
4) Eleleth, the great angel- one of the four light givers, with the souls who did not understand their perfection yet they did not repent immediately but they persisted a little while. In the end however, they repented. They will remain with Eleleth, glorifying the invisible spirit. 

Thomas 12
The disciples said to Jesus, ""we know you will depart from us. Who is to be our leader?""
Jesus said to them, ""wherever you are, you are to go to James the Righteous, for whose sake heaven and Earth came into being.""

(Apoc of James) James prays-
""And I pray the beginning may come from you, for thus I shall be capable of salvation, since they will be enlightened through me, by my faith...""

(Apoc of James)
For cast away from you the cup of bitterness... For you have begun to understand their roots from the beginning to end. When you speak of these words of this perception, encourage these four-
1) Salome
2) Mariam
3) Martha
4) Arsinoe -

Who is Arsinoe? An Egyptian Queen
Who is Arsinoe the Fourth? 40 years before Jesus, she would have been familiar to Him.  Arsinoe IV is
the teenage Egyptian Queen, sister of Cleopatra, who fought Caesar in a battle and won!  But her sister Cleopatra convinced Marc Antony to capture and martyr Arsinoe.

SuperBluesify,"One thing I noticed Peterson plays up is peoples’ complicated relationships with their mothers. I think some people out there naturally have resentment towards their mothers because to be frank their moms might have been overbearing, abusive, emotionally unregulated and so on but Peterson says the solution is more masculine upbringing or a disconnect from the mom. I think he’s wrong here but since it plays into peoples anger they hear someone speaking to their unresolved emotions and think it’s true. Their anger feels now justified in blame. There’s another option Peterson is missing. That option is for the mom to get the help she needs so she doesn’t have that type of relationship with her son or children. I don’t think it’s an issue with masculinity or femininity, I think it’s an issue with emotion regulation skills,
mindfulness and bringing that to child rearing. there are plenty of families who never stop having close relationships with their parents or just one of their parents and it’s healthy because the parents were initially healthy. But they are the exception, and people struggling with mental health is a big issue in America and I think Peterson in a self important way monetarily takes advantage of that.",2021-07-22T22:18:51Z,1,0

Pryde Foltz,"""Is is an idea worth thinking about for a while"" ... that is called diplomacy. LOL.  

The thing is men consume as much as women and we both have an instinct to bring back sustenance to the family and tribe in one way or another. For a long time, it was tasked to women to do most of the shopping for the household and so the advertising was mostly targeted towards women. I think it may be more of a case of situational legacy than that consuming is a misplaced worship of the feminine. I mean have we really stopped worshipping yin and yang energies is other ways ... if you know what I mean. Ask your wife. This is obviously  also  part of advertising tactics. 

To the devouring mother; she has of course been denied an outlet for her divine sexuality and as such her energies become over-focused on nurturing her children because the egos natural drive to free itself, we get contrast between child and parent. A lack of balance generally experienced through resentment is where the suffering and demonization begins.  The devouring parent is a very dangerous misogynist concept  and used to disenfranchise women from politic power. The racial hatred portion aside, calling a woman a 'Karen' removes the place for the elder female at the council. It silences wisdom as it flows through older women. De-sexed and silenced what role is left her but that of child-nurturer. This is why we continue to need feminism. 

If we want to avoid imbalance in our relationships ... and really that is what you are both getting at; situations and relationships only become 'toxic' when there is an imbalance. Men and women, non-binaries, must be freer to explore identity without dualistic bounds and expectations. The individual should be free to flow between the yin and yang concepts and not limited by either. 

I think the only real limit any enlightening individual needs is the golden rule. Treat others (and the environment) as you would wish to be treated. This requires empathetic abilities which are natural for some and can be taught through role-play and thought experiments for others. 

As a feminist ... systems should not be constructed to disadvantage/advantage any group of people over another, and we should all have equal rights under the law, I find this talk about masculinity and femininity counter-productive and animosity-driving. It literally pits feminists (just a word) against feminists. (Let's just say people who are pro-equality and anti-oppression. That's just about all of us.) 

When you have the balance right, you will know because you feel and look good. Others will note it and feel good to be around you. We all want to feel free but also supported and appreciated. Remember this and remember it is not your job to get the balance right for another because you can't. Appreciate them and allow them the space to gain their own balance, but certainly, particularly if they have soft cranial parts, keep them from falling to their death.  Gentleness and age appropriate limits make sense and if you are particularly artful at applying them, a child will appreciate them and may not even notice you have.

Josephine Gutierrez,"Dear Russel. I know you probably won't read this, however, I feel the need to express it.
I stopped watching tv or commercial movies about 20 years ago (inner preservation). I knew you existed as a celebrity only because I remember seeing your face and hearing your name in passing on  occasions when I happened to be in a place where the TV was on and got a glimpse when passing by. I guessed you were kind of famous or something at the time. 

This is to say that I just knew a bit more about you a few weeks ago when one of your videos appeared as a suggestion in my youtube channel. I read the video title and although I don't remember at this moment what it was about, I do remember being curious that a celebrity was talking about certain subjects. Only then I watched the one titled ¨Does fame make you insane?¨ 

I don't mean to sound cruel, but  I am glad that you went through several experiences. Now It is like your spiritual powers have been restored because the wisdom and depth you gained from them now enables you not only to live life fully but also to help others to learn more about so many important topics that now more than ever we all need to get a grip on. I enjoy watching you explaining things, information and communicating your ideas in such a thoughtful, intelligent and articulated manner.Above all, I find beauty, truth and love in your words.

I´m also glad for the hard experiences I went through because I have also gained wisdom. That's why now  I can really appreciate the work you´re doing and understand your ideas, many of them are reflections of my own. You also make me laugh a lot and I LOVE laughing.

I hope I have expressed my ideas properly. English is not my native tongue, so please forgive any typos or grammar mistakes.
 I am happy you´re here with us. Thank you.",2021-07-22T21:04:53Z,0,0

Better you try being less emotional so as not to arrive at such cloudy conclusions about things and people you have no idea about. In fact, go and have a good time, a good laugh, and see how some spontaneity and some fun works wonders when dealing with people. Hint: directness, honesty, some human-to-human banter and a laugh often does the trick much better than some 'restrained, straight, serious professional with integrity' or whatever that you are trying to reduce my work down to.

You 'Psychologists' are MEANT to be a part of the healing professions.
So perhaps you should straighten up a little and take your role seriously.
How do you think that Mothers feel after reading your comments above? Are they going to develop faith in jerks such as yourself?

I often have the chance to have direct conversations with such mothers about how they may be the cause various issues that have begun to surface as their 'baby' begins to turn into someone she no longer recognises, or in some cases a monster that is rather resentful towards her.",2021-07-23T12:29:54Z,3,

Trashman,"Toxic masculinity in accordance to wikipedia: ""The concept of toxic masculinity is used in academic and media discussions of masculinity to refer to certain cultural norms that are associated with harm to society and men themselves. Traditional stereotypes of men as socially dominant, along with related traits such as misogyny and homophobia, can be considered ""toxic"" due in part to their promotion of violence, including sexual assault and domestic violence. The socialization of boys in patriarchal societies often normalizes violence, such as in the saying ""boys will be boys"" about bullying and aggression."" Right. So men were different in the 1960's? (Vietnam) 1940's? (WW2), 1810? Napoleonic wars... Then the Romans, Greeks, Myans (blood for the blood god), Egyptians and all the way down to the Sumerians. Toxic masculinity, just more intellectualised, media influenced bullshit. ""We don't like men being like this! So we're going state that it's MORRIALLY WRONG!!!"" Just more politically correct bullshit. Or, please tell me were these men of love and kindness and giving and empathy are in history - Jesus? The Romans caught that guy and nailed him to a tree. Toxic masculinity a truth? Or just those in power, fearful of religion no longer being able to suppress the masses, creating another moral code to suppress the masses? Billionaires getting richer, gap between rich and poor growing, Biden proving to be impotent, present day democracy getting scrutinised more than ever before... Roll out toxic masculinity, gender politics, wokeness - that'll keep them busy while all the billionaires jet off to space... Just get some university, pseudo moral intelligence guy, chuck cash at him and he'll go out and milk it for all it's worth... Yeah, let's roll with that while we make the gaps between the rich and poor even bigger... Champagne anyone? And don't worry, I'll pour liberally so all the spillage the poor can come and suck outta the sand... Who says it doesn't trickle down? Smoke and mirrors, completely useless conversations which do nothing, say nothing and go nowhere. Said with big words though so guess it must be important. Whatever. Go on Peterson, tell us this - how do we change the western governments of the world to narrow the gap between rich and poor, hold companies and individuals in those companies to account (jail and the like), and ensure, going forward, that our governments put the peoples of their countries first. When you've finished telling us, go and do it. When it's done I'll start taking you seriously - up until then your just a hot air hack making quick bucks while the potato's hot.",2021-07-22T20:41:29Z,0,0

Women need to be accepted and loved and men need to back off and allow everyone to be equal. We are 99% alike it is only white men who create divisions in all aspects. im having trouble listen to a white man support masculinity and those ideas because its not working it never has... also is he a parent while hes giving parenting advice?

Then of course there was the influence of World Wars.
The problems are Societal and Cultural far more deeply than they are merely Parental.. or even Contemporarily Parental as you appear to suggest.
Narcissism is flourishing in response to Devaluation... This is not just devaluation of individuals by Parents whilst in sensitive early stages of personality development.. but is a wider devaluation by Culture (especially Capitalist Commodity Culture also).

A male prostitute in drag serving unbiasedly
Is behaving gawking mad,
Delerious,
Hysterical,
Dramatic

Out on the street

Mocking women , in jest. 

And someone says, indirectly, that that is ""feminine"".

That is misappropriation of the vocabulary feminine. 

Language doesn't evolve. It's illiteracy. 

A male behaves like a male does,
Because our brain chemistry is a masculine brain. 

We are conniving. 
We always know our current bearings. We are that introspective. Not where we are going per say, what where our psychological feet are laid.
That's a part of what Masculinity pertains to. 

The person calling this activity, of the prostitute, feminine, 
Has no clue what feminine means,

And so the point is that 

If you don't know what the Word pertains to

You aren't using the word right at all. No matter what word: you must know what a word means to attribute it as a convention of an expression coherently.

Laurence Young,The beginning of this chat reminds me a lot of the book 'iron john' which goes through the message we are told through fairytale story's on moving towards manhood.

Martin 'Heal Our Love' Camden,"> TO EVERYONE

FROM DESPISÈD

Martin Camden

(autistic me) !!

 

Jesus was despisèd -- isn't it odd that honesty is supposed to be a virtue, but nobody wants to hear the truth? .... or they can't understand it? .... or they don't want it to be true? .... or they don't want to feel stupid? .... or they don't want to know how stupid they actually are? .... or any permutation of any to all of the above?

 

FROM HANDEL'S MESSIAH

Listen to it and enjoy ....

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CP4JSVMBdZg !!

 

** Abortion Options

Added to Rules 5a & 5b **

** Mirror-Work

Added to Rule 4 **

 

Martin's 4 Rules of Life

and Choice of Rule 5a or 5b ....

 

Rule 1:  When tempted, don't do it -- except, perhaps, as a one off treat -- or to see what happens (a social science experiment), or as part of worthy group celebration !!

It's when indulging your base self becomes a bad habit that you take no notice of, then the rot sets in, spreading from person to person, and ultimately destroying all semblance of civilisation !!

Take note of your temptation-led bad habits, and then overlay them with good ones -- ""Form good habits and become their slaves."" -- Og Mandino & Dave Blanchard (see Dave's book:

""Today, I Begin a New Life"") !!

Q:  Tempted to do what exactly?

Temptation is a feeling -- you know when you're about to do or say something dodgy, but you might not notice this when a bad habit has become a way of life, or a way of coping, and/or a way protesting -- i.e. a bad to useless to counterproductive habit !!

Rule 2:  Always be doing a few things deliberately at all times -- don't just live a life of nothing but default !!

Rule 3:  Practise getting your priorities right -- NB: practice makes perfect !!

Rule 4:  Practise tailoring your messages to your audiences (of one, few or many) -- what is the point in speaking if you make no difference, or make matters worse?

Rule 4.1:  Talk to yourself in front of a mirror -- practise inspirational speaking (your favourite quotations / soliloquys) -- or practise giving yourself a lecture -- or rehearse addressing an audience with off-the-cuff public speaking !!

 

Shakespeare Soliloquys:

""To be, or not to be ....

and

""Friends, Romans, Countrymen ....

and

""All the world's a stage, and all the people in it merely lemmings ....

and

""There is nothing either good or bad that thinking makes it so ....

and

“Shall I compared thee to a summer’s day? Thou art more lovely and more temperate. Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May, and summer’s lease hath all too short a date ....

 

Rule 5a:  It's okay to kill people (even children, and foetuses, and embryos -- scrap the crime of murder), but it's not okay to torture anyone, and it's not okay to damage the environment, or to damage infrastructure, and it's not okay to make life harder for the living !!

Rule 5a.1:  Send in the SAS to kill or be killed, but don't bomb / damage any building -- neutron bombs are okay (these kill all life, but leave the buildings standing) !!

Rule 5a.2:  Don't scar the environment, nor any landscape, nor any cityscape, and don't make anywhere look like a s**t-hole !!

Rule 5a.3:  Free abortion on demand (no time limits) / free caesareans on demand / free sterilisation on demand // resultant viable babies to be supported / adopted !!

ALTERNATIVELY (let the electorate decide) ....

Rule 5b:  If human life is to be considered sacred, then all weapons of potential death must be destroyed -- but maybe knives could be used with a licence?

Rule 5b:  The deadline for 'abortions of convenience' should be cut in half to see if all this feminist fear-mongering has basis in reality, or not -- (24 weeks down to 12 weeks in the UK) !!

 

ALL GLOBAL CITIZENS TO UNDERSTAND ALL OF THESE RULES, AND TO DISCUSS OPENLY AND PUBLICALLY THE PROS AND CONS OF 5a VERSUS 5b !!

Freed Promise Project FPPhelps,"Great insightful video as always.

We have to separate the Virtute (Latin for masculine virtue) from toxic masculinity and stop lumping them together. The issue with toxic masculinity isn't the masculinity part but the toxic.

Undeniably we are in a period where masculinity is OPENLY held accountable I think it is ironic how ""un-manlike"" some seem to be handling it. We are just becoming aware of how others have been quietly viewing us this whole time and are not liking it.

Perhaps we should take an example from what you did Russell Brand and reinvent ourselves as someone we can be proud of instead of attacking those who are pointing out the very real flaws in our toxic behavior.",2021-07-22T18:02:09Z,0,0

Chris YaBoi,"""Whatcha reckon??"" Immediately followed by ""I made it up"" is both hilarious and also very commendable to be honest. To many folks spouting off smart ""sounding"" bullshit trying to pass it off as something profound.

Russell may very well have a great point. But he admits immediately that it might be rubbish and he only means to pick it apart with someone else to see if the idea holds water.

scruffy makaveli,"It depends on what the kid needs rather than what it wants. Fairy godmothers in movies help out a lot but they don't do everything. The fairy godmother gave snow white a beautiful dress in order to have a chance at winning the heart of the prince. The godmother didn't outright gave her the keys to his heart. Gandalf always rescued the Hobbits in dangerous situations, yet he couldn't bear the ring for Frodo.

I have a nephew working hard on his independence. He got ripped off on a car deal and lost his mode of transportation and a couple grand of his own money. His grandma and I helped him make a better decision on who to buy a car from and pitched in to make sure it was the right car to keep his life on track. We're not swooping in to save the day every time something goes wrong, but we're also not going to let him fall into squalor because he can't get to and from work.",2021-07-22T20:20:07Z,2,

Julia O'Shaughnessy,"I think Masculinity in men should be encouraged, celebrated and given legitimate purpose. I agree pushing this down has serious detrimental affects. A lot of young males who are attracted to terrorist groups- it is because of the 'celebration and ability to express' their traditionally masculine traits - fighting, honour, 'protecting' against threat, bravery, leadership. Western world closes off access to occupations which would utilise these 'masculine' traits - eg., UK now needs a 'degree' to be a police officer. Equally, I like your theory that the oppression of females has led to the celebration of divine feminine through the only accepted mainstream avenue left - consumerism and the objectification of the female body. It's probably not a coincidence that 80% of people in 'spiritual' circles are women (don't quote me on the percentage lols). The crone definitely represents how invisible women become when we're older/less attractive - therefore culturally irrelevant. Maleficent ('male-efficient') portrayed as the Alpha Female - strong, but therefore evil and must be defeated being stabbed by Prince Philips 'sword of truth'. It's amazing how women have been encouraged to be 'independent', but I can tell you it's the quickest way to end up single lols! All my whiney, weak, bit selfish, disorganised female friends (like the Murphy's I'm not bitter love them really lols) are married with lovely guys. All the strong, independent, career minded women who don't take any cr@p - single, single, single. Society doesn't like alpha females - unless they're comedians, and often even not then unless it's self-flagellating comedy.. that might not be the right word, but you know what I mean lols. Tony Robbins 'Not my Guru' had a 'devouring mother'. The 'shadow' of ourselves must be incorporated, integrated, loved and accepted to stop it growing in the darkness and turning into the part of ourselves that lashes out and self-sabotages our success. The 'othering' of the shadow of ourselves leads to the shadowing of anything in our external lives which we see as 'other' - therefore creating division, at a time, when as you say - unity, collaboration, understanding what makes us 'the same' rather than different to each other is the most important goal. Society seems to be in a process of 'othering' masculinity and I find it quite an abusive process (towards males) to watch if I'm honest. I'm glad guys like Jordan are 'bringing it back', maybe less young men will feel hopeless and want to become INCELS or terrorists. Anyway, wasn't expecting to blather on like that. PS: I watch a LOT of youtube, but only heard of Jordan through this series. The algorithym Gods did not favour you until now Jordan lols.",2021-07-22T17:52:20Z,0,0

Concha de conchos,"Just gonna put this out there, I am interested in any answer. What’s up with all the gay jokes? I have observed so many men and only men make gay jokes as if they were knock knock jokes. Seems like every 3 sentences there is a gay joke or the sentence can be seen as “sus” similar to saying “ I like sausages”. Now I see laughter come from these, but also it is almost like there isn’t an option, if one does not properly receive a gay joke they are met with “ that means you are gay in the inside”. Or something around the lines that they do not know themselves. This doesn’t make sense to me, if you go just one generation back there was no such a thing even as a form of laughter, if I tell my dad something sus like I so much hear he will surely give me an eyebrow raise, not out of disappointment or anything like that but instead like “ what did he just say, where did that come  from?” Bc you are basically hitting on your bro like you would a girl you like, but you just laugh it off. I have heard the phrase “we are all a little gay inside” perhaps it is just about accepting it. But my answer to this is after 6 years of gay jokes becoming common around me it just isn’t funny anymore. I eventually am gonna stop laughing when my bro says “ let me suck yo dick” or getting my ass slapped or calling eachother daddy yet it is taken as being secretly gay to do so. Feel free to put your most sincere answer. I am only looking to understand this phenomenon. I also should mention it seems to be a culture thing, my cousin who grew up in Mexico also raised his eyebrow at a balls joke he heard.

VicariousVictor,"@Lord Feder I think I'm realizing I'm having a problem with the use of language here. Femininity and masculinity, by definition are having qualities or characteristic of females and males. So when you say feminine people (both men and women) are more creative, etc., it really doesn't make a lot of sense to me. Like, when it comes to people being creative, and both sexes have the capacity for it, why are we labeling it with gender loaded wording? Same goes for the authoritarian, etc. Both sexes have the capacity for it, so again, why the need to continue with gender loading terms? For me, the initial reason for doing so seems quite clear in a functional myth sense. IE: they reinforce men being at the top of the hierarchy and in doing so, make it appear that this is the natural way of things, hence the need to label things such as chaos, the irrational, as ""feminine"" qualities (as typically associated with actual biological females, with negative connotations). In short, (I hate to have to use this term, but here goes), it functions to support a patriarchal system.

Audrey R,"@Lord Feder I'm glad this gave you some food for thought :)

I wouldn't necessarily say that roles are exchanging, because there is a significant gap between the mainstream discourse, which is mostly intended to make money (think of those Disney remakes where we're being told that their only reason to exist is because the original female character was not strong enough...), and reality. That is why it is so important to listen to people instead of making opinions based on what we see online, especially considering how toxic social media can be.

For instance, you're saying that you've had issues with people for being too feminine as a man, but where is the real issue: feminist discourses that aim at freeing people from expectations based on their gender, or a vision of masculinity that doesn't allow men to express their feminine side? 
As someone who was raised by a soldier with PTSD, I can tell you that he made me hate myself so much as a woman that for a really long time I even resented feminine men for feeling free to express a side of themselves that I was suppressing in me. It took me many years to deconstruct everything that I had inherited from his way of seeing the world. The problem is that unlearning things is so hard that a lot of young people would rather follow the same path that made their parents suffer. That's why a lot of young men would rather ""man up"" than put this injunction into question.. Of course, being too agreeable is never a good thing, but it's up to you to assess if self-confidence will come with more masculinity, or by actually coming to terms with who you are, no matter what everyone else expects from you...",2021-07-23T14:36:05Z,3,
Lord Feder,"@Audrey R  mmm that's a great argument, I will have to think about it. 
personally I'm quite a feminine male and I've always had so much problems with people, I think being more masculine would help for example with social interactions (less anxiety, more self esteem). that's why I think masculinity would be beneficial to some people. especially men in this period. (I know a lot of guys with agreeableness problems).
but it's also true that feminist tends to me masculine in their way of expression... so I don't know. it's like the roles are exchanging.

I can say that both sides become dangerous if pushed to the extremes.",2021-07-23T13:28:10Z,3,
Audrey R,"@Lord Feder  I'm sorry but reading everything you wrote makes me wonder if you ever made the effort to talk to actual people and listen to their experiences. 
You say it yourself that you are talking about femininity and masculinity, not women and men, yet you say the feminine is ""idolised"" because of the ""feminist propaganda"", which is about women, not feminity. Nowadays feminists tend to use the language of men, they can be agressive and assertive, thus enforcing ""masculine"" traits in women. Vulnerability and sensitivity, traditionally ""feminine"" traits, are not highly regarded in today's society, even in women, so it contradicts your argument that feminity is idolised. A lot of women nowadays actually struggle to come to terms with their feminity for fear of being seen as weak or inferior, because that's what we heard growing up. 

As for feeling demoralised because women are ""always"" depicted as victims, isn't that victimisation ? Why not take a step back and actually wonder if there are some elements of truth in it? Why not listen to people around you, anyone who has suffered, both men and women, and ask yourself if there is not something about traditional discourses around masculinity that do a great disservice to both sexes?

One of my uncle committed suicide. I later learned that he was a victim of incest. Traditionally men do not speak up because in people's minds only women are victims of sexual violence and a man who speaks up would be ""emasculated"" (again, something initially against women that then turns against men). So he preferred killing himself. I thus discovered several incestuous men in my family. All of them at the top of the familial hierarchy, all of them protected. Why? For the sake of order, this so-called masculine virtue...",2021-07-23T13:04:26Z,8,

Lord Feder,"@VicariousVictor   those are very big topics. you should watch more of Peterson if you want long and articulate explanations.

I can say that to me femininity is more related to chaos because feminine people (both men and women) tends to be more creative, emotional and have hard time in deciding what they wanna do (like choosing a specific career path for example). masculine people instead are more authoritarian, ordered and technical. they often know exactly what they want to do. those are the kind of people that work with ""things"" rather than with people (engineers, technicians ecc).

you can see femininity It's idolized by how the media is pushing this feminist propaganda in every media possible. it looks like as if the women are always the victims and men always the tyrants. and that is demoralizing men and making be masculine a shame rather than a virtue. and in this time and place authority it's something that people needs so much. you can see it by how many people follow Peterson's videos and like his mindset.

I know this is all very abstract and I'm not even english so I'm having an hard time explaining it xD but if you really want to know more listen to past Peterson lectures and interviews on the argument like the cathy newman interview ecc ecc.",2021-07-23T10:02:16Z,1,

""feminine is chaotic, that's why it has to be controlled."" Outside the realm of myth, what does ""femininity or masculinity"" have anything to do with the concepts of chaos/order? And in what ways is ""the feminine"" idolized, and what is ""healthy masculinity""? Not that I necessarily disagree, I just favor more concrete examples, instead of just granting assumptions or generalizations that may or may not sound good.",2021-07-23T01:13:15Z,8,
Lord Feder,"@VicariousVictor yes but I wasn't speaking about males and female but about femininity and masculinity in both men and women. 
I think Peterson doesn't speak about the femininity in men because in this society the feminine is idolized and pushed as a preferable trait in both men and women. it's the healthy masculinity that is lacking nowadays.",2021-07-22T22:22:29Z,3,

And remember you're talking the realm of myth, which usually functions to reinforce a culture/society, not to necessarily express any reality, or truism. And why all the neglect of the feminine in men? Neither Brand or Peterson really addressed it. It kind of surprised me since Peterson is supposedly a Jungian (anima?).

Lord Feder,"@Lau Ste if you're interested in the argument you should watch more Peterson lectures. in mythology feminine is represented as chaotic and creative and masculinity as authoritarian and orderly. and that's true because you can see that it's more common for women to be creative and for men to be technical. it's natural.

GreyHunter,"@trey darling I understand where you're coming from, but I think you're missing a key nuance. 

These original groups had protections in place which in effect restricted speech, because the provisions were a list of things you could not do. You could NOT restrict service to a certain racial group. You could NOT refer to homosexuals in the workplace with offensive slurs. 

The gender identity marker is unique in that it can require proactive effort on behalf of the other party. If someone says they want to be referred to by a certain pronoun, you HAVE to refer to them as such or it can be seen as a violation. 

A hypothetical would be if legislation were to pass that could effectively force everyone to refer to Jews as ""The Chosen Peoples"" or be considered anti-Semitic. There is clearly a big difference in not being able to discriminate against someone for being Jewish, and having to call someone a member of ""The Chosen People"". 

This situation sounds ridiculous, but it's the same line of reasoning, and could be supported with the same arguments as enforcing self-selected pronouns. This is why the trans-issue was a flashpoint, because it was a unique situation. 

I am fairly confident that the overwhelming majority of people who were critical of bill C-16 had no issues with trans-people in general. The truth is simply that if not calling someone by their pronouns becomes equivalent to calling someone an ethnic slur, then you have no choice but to call people what they dictate, and your speech has been compelled. 

Obviously I understand the argument that this is mainly about protecting trans-people from things like not being given housing or educational opportunities, and that this compelled speech thing won't ever be enforced. The issue is that government rarely decides to roll back its power, and once something is in law, precedent makes it much easier to apply that same rule somewhere else.

But if you were to ask JP if this was his message, he'd go ""no no no I'm not saying that it's women's fault, I'm just saying it's a problem"".

Its good that you don't worry about it and your good with you being you, that's the way it should be.

Britain join forces with USA and had no economic power to follow the research, therefore it was handed over to USA to finish the project.

My responsibilities mean that I should not look to make war, yet be ready for war when the needs arise. 

The strength minus should be at the point to where we know ourselves well enough that another veiw does not destroy us. This lends to tolerance of the small differences and willingness to work on the larger ones. This naturally offsets struggle and strife.

First nuclear test 1945

Key notes einstine being a pacifist was originally against nuclear weapons.
However being a jewish refugee from Hitler's rule he was certain the Nazis where the last ones he wanted to have them. Hence his promoting american efforts into nuclear weapon research.

Maitrī,"The problem with these kinds of argumentations is actually the same that creates the presumably “extremist feminist positions” (which I would not define as properly feminist at all – they are so only in the eyes of right-wing and conservative commentators that want to obscure the real issues behind social inequalities). Both are embedded in an ideological battle around the definition of ""man"" and ""female"". But we have to change those paradigms. A strong distinction between allegedly masculine and feminine core-traits brings no good whatsoever. This distinction could have some biological basis - differences in neurobiology as well as obviously different physical features - but the problem arises when we feel the need to define a distinction based on culturally created features. Let's elaborate that. Maybe we should just start to think about us as humans and to define the ""positivity"" of our being in the world in relation to what we do for others, not in relation to our gender or other overarching categories. It's not important to be a ""man"", as well as it's not important to be a ""woman"". Those categories work only inside the same fundamental structure, that is the cultural distinction of gender-traits and the subsequential power-dynamics that our culture had created in the past. Let me clarify. The reason why women strive toward a legitimate and just equality with men has to be found in the prior, unjust distinction between the genders that a male- and powercentric society had created. We had firstly created a distinction that goes beyond the mere biological differentiation of the genders (men and woman) and then we established a hierarchy in which men sat at the top and women were the ""weak, subordinate gender"". Within this theoretical structure, it's normal and just that women want to be empowered and want to restore a gender equality that has been negated. We, as humanity, have literally suppressed and subjugated a part of our own species, in the same way that has been done with racism and other forms of oppression. But (and that's the tricky part that could upset more than somebody): if we don't posit any differentiation, the rest of the theoretical and hierarchical structure literally falls apart. You can ""adhere"" to an allegedly female or masculine representation of what you are and that's fine, in the sense that's a free choice. The problem is that we don't really need it. If we could just give up to such a power-related necessity of distinction, men wouldn't need to defend themselves, because there would be nothing to defend (masculinity? what's that? I'm just a human being, with individual and unique traits of whatever kind). And, if and only if we change paradigm, women wouldn't need to fight for their empowerment, because there wouldn't be any power structure and oppression in the first place. There's no strong, powerful, assertive etc. masculinity to defend, because that's an illusion (letting aside the fact that those characteristics are inherently violent to a certain extent and, maybe, should be substituted with a culture of compassion, individual freedom and vulnerability). In this case, we would be human beings, doing and working and living in society which embraces the differences, without creating distinctions. What matters is what we do for other people and for our own happiness. All other discussions, such as the one in this video, are only a way to spread unnecessary violence and distinction that we don't need.",2022-04-10T11:37:08Z,0,

Also, just for your knowledge, 67% of UK women identify as feminist and it’s been over twenty years now since women have become part of the armed forces and I know many service MEN who admire and respect their female comrades. Women fight for their country and die for their country too. I genuinely don’t see what the problem is here, I doubt you ever been to Europe or the UK, I assure you that there are millions of men and women here who think the same as me. Babbling nonsense about plumbers and scientists has no connection with our subject, which is about men needing protection and support just like women: no, I’m not grateful for the scientists, just as I’m not resentful about the dictators who all happened to be men.

LOSTINFICTIONENGLAND,"@whokilled JR no, I'm not lying: 1) if a male colleague has a nervous breakdown or simply cries (unless it's for something trivial, like his football real lost) go and comfort it and so does every female I know: that's because my female friends and I are decent human beings,  I'm sorry if Canada is filled with selfish bitches(also, Peterson cries all the time on video and people dont feel put off by it)  2) I recently moved to Italy, where deaths on the job are the highest in Europe and both men and women die: the death of women (15 just in 2020) hadn't changed anything, really no one gives a fuck about workers ' gender, as long as they're cheap. 3) in the UK, whenever I had a very civil confrontation with a male colleague (I'm British  and was raised in a way that forbids me to raise my voice) the colleague was right and I was wrong and treated with contempt, and not only when I was dealing with an older colleague, but almost always. 4) some women use tears at their advantage,  to silence everyone,  not only men: this scenario when a man and a woman discuss and she cries and the man gets a look of contempt is totally valid even when two women discuss and one cries: the other gets a look of contempt and is automatically a bitch!

whokilled JR,"@LOSTINFICTIONENGLAND I'm not american to start off with. To address your post, both genders have behavioral traits that evoke different responses with pros and cons for both. Consider this, you're sitting in an office and a male colleague breaks down bawling his eyes out. Are you going to feel compelled to wrap your arms around him and comfort him? You'd either be lying or not thinking about it considerably if you said yes, we're not built in a way to be protective or emotionally supportive to men around us. Rather what happens is a feeling of awkwardness. On the odd occasion in my life when I've shown such emotion, the looks i get from others are that of ""wtf"", ok, ok, you're an alien, this is awkward, just be ok now.
In an office if there's a confrontation between a male and female and it gets emotional, regardless of who's in the right it's the female that gets the sympathy and the male that's most likely going to be on the receiving end of a stern talk with the manager.
This behavior extends into all walks of life. Safety measures are taken much more seriously and action is often taken if a women is a casualty at work, in spite of the fact that it's 95% men. This happened in canada, where an accident at work to a female caused the industry to upgrade it's safety measures and ended up likely saving thousands of men over the years.

I watch professor Peterson first as a way to see what the fuss was about during the whole canada thing. I found the things he was saying are in abstract simple and things I had practice all along. However the way he digs into his points and the breath of information he weaves together i found fascinating.

I watch brand becuase he was a funny guy. Come to find out he has quite the intellect on him, something i thought he might have had when he was acting but had no signs for or against.

Jacco,"@Piccalilli Pit I find it a little ironic how much you're boasting about yourself and putting down others, whilst saying stuff like 'masculine man don't watch videos about masculinity' creating your own definition of masculinity and presenting it as a fact, whilst also saying you're doing a piece on narcissism classifying Dr. Peterson as a narcissist. I wonder who actually might be doing the projecting here 🤔

Ps. This isn't meant as an attack on your person but as a reflective feedback piece.",2021-07-22T19:04:51Z,14,

whokilled JR,"@spong mongler it's biologically ingrained via our habits and evolution over hundreds of thousands of years. Men are very protective, it's the reason why as hunter gatherer's men positioned themselves on the outskirts of tribes, to protect the women and children from dangerous predators. It's the reason why men are more risk adverse, more expendable and die more doing dangerous jobs. It's also logical, tribes of people that prioritized safety of women were obviously more successful, given that minimal numbers of men could impregnate women and continue population growth. To say masculinity is an opinion defies science and likely fits in with a certain group of people that favour peroxide hair.",2021-07-22T18:40:00Z,12,

It's almost impossible to put a human being in a specific place in time and say ""this human is fully what he is supposed to be"".

It's absurd just to think of it.

Our society constrains us to a level that none of us are even aware of it.

So to say that ""oh, but 30 years ago men were men"" is just the same absurdity of saying ""oh, music was a lot better when I was a kid"".

All of us can say that, but that's exactly the influence of society I'm speaking of. And it's absolutely not true.",2021-07-22T17:20:24Z,8,
