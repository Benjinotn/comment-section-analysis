9,rt don t use bottled water get a brita or whatever the fuck and drink outta dat fr,it hurts to know the reason you got hurt is because you re forwards,we need to push for all of our american politicians as far as the presidential debates go to be put on a platform like this or joe rogan s as a mandatory stop on the way to presidency no more sound bite decision making,why won t they use fish nets i know problem is more complex but it could be used in more effective ways much much cheaper than electric power house,most women do not want to deal with male pain if it interferes with the satisfaction of female desire yeah everyone who supports the red pill agrees with you there s a reason women have such distain for these men because it s not attractive why emotional men are reckless women perceive them as dangerous and not in a bad boy kind of good way as in he can t control his emotions he might hurt me kind of way men who allow their emotions to dictate their actions are a complete disaster an unreactive man is a good man why do certain men abuse their women or kids because they are unable to control their emotions why do certain men rape because they are unable to control their desires why do certain men feel the need to kick the shit out of each other because they are unable to control their anger telling men to express their emotions is a very bad message a good man is a stoic man he does not allow how he feels to dictate his actions he is in control of his mind is mind is not in control of him you shouldn t talk about your emotions with a women if you want her to stick around women are simply not attracted to weak men who are not in control of their own life because weak men who aren t in control are dangerous
10,what a king you re my only hope for your gen,never ever believe anything a woman says the exact opposite of what they say is what they want,hey when you do interviews can you pull the shot out abit there s a lot of move movement and camera switching i ve smoke 2 blunt and 8th of caps fam i m trying to keep up but i have to close my eyes dam near,how does it stun the fish but kill a person,the patriarchy oh boy
11,need to make a first day out song,it pisses me off that women choose the men who are assholes toward them who ll abuse them and shit like that instead of dating a nice guy i ll never understand why some women are like that this generation of dating sucks since when did it become a bad thing to be too nice to a woman if she wants me to change ha good riddance another thing that pisses me off is the term simp who came up with that lame word anyway i bet some immature little boy,nobody wants to listen to peterson thanks,they should add a huge dry dock and recycle the water they use to fill and empty it,was that maple story character select music 1 10
12,yo i can contest this view the cause of the endocrine disruption of modern day and age are not phytoestrogens we ve been exposed to those for the whole history of humanity they re present in all plants not just soy the cause are synthetic disruptors like bpa i can explain the mechanism scientifically educate the public and provide sources for everything i don t do youtube usually but this is important enough if you re interested for collab let me know,i wish u did videos for women cuz u for sure speak straight facts i laughed a few times watching this bc a lot of it is just true esp the part when u said after a break up the girl goes to the guy shes always lusted over cuzzzzz yea i like watching these videos to see how yall b thinking i just like learning about human psychology in general and the way the mind works you should think about doing a channel for women too we need you too,great your name suits you,they playing real life tower defense out here,it soo funny to see everyone glance over the actual positions and merits of the rp philosophy and completely disregard the reason people are drawn to it in the first place in this community what is idealized is the nuclear family and a marriage with a young woman who is able to create a large family while that marriage lasts a lifetime if one is going to happen at all these men idealize and want to become the gentil patriarch or heroic artisan are also probably religious conservatives and capitalist s if you want to make a video about dissecting rp or manosphere go over the people like rollo tammassi patrice o neil alexander grace tom leykis some simple truths dating for most men is trash especially in the modern age i e demanding traditional male role while not fufilling the traditionally female role social media expands dating pools exponentially in the past everyone would be out and about not glued to their phone giving more opportunities to the average man men s sexual thirst for women on the net is mostly at fault here why date one average guy when you could have 1000 s of simps paying 5 a month to see ur puss puss average man by modern standards cant support a family let alone a woman s ever growing expectations 5 7 5 8 42k yr 39 waist one of the most common statements is that women prefer men who make 1 5x what they do minimum disregarding the ones who say 100k only or 250k or other dumb shit housing prices are also so high that in most cities 50k a year wont qualify you to purchase a house something essential for building wealth and establishing a family they say women want it all but most men would be satisfied being happy divorce is initiated by women 70 80 of the time and even more if college educated women wait to meet winners at the finish line ever since school age the men who where most desired had things wealth or looks while the rest got as close to 0 attention as humanly possible once we achieve and grow we eventually become a preferred choice after being disrespected for decades then you expect us to accept children out of wedlock and want guys to pay for all your kids macdonald s the system is designed to be played by a 2 person team and there are hardly any teammates available if 2 people made 80 100k and were willing to move to a less desirable place a family unit could easily be established theres still 50 100k houses for sale in america women don t do their part in reducing costs of building a family and instead want to compete for the breadwinner position and in doing so only increase the expenses a family must put out to cover a 2 working person house hold the whole point of a breadwinner horseperson is to make the breadwinner able to work more because one simply cannot work 60 80hrs and do home stuff and home stuff like cooking diy improvements childcare management housework are all significant causes for expense that can be mitigated through one person dedicating themselves to reducing those costs ex i could go to a restaurant and spend 50 on one meal but that same 50 in the grocery store could feed a family of four for 1 2 meals same with child care its likely going to cost 60 80 of a persons wage to cover child care without government funding most household tasks can be done simultaneously giving more personal time than would be possible in the jobs most breadwinners would take one of the most common complaints on this subject is that homemaking doesn t pay yes and no yes because it doesn t pay you with a check every 2 week but if you took his last name 50 of the equity is yours no matter what while childrearing also provides you with a guaranteed income post marriage if you decide to leave for any reason valid or not competition for the breadwinner position also increases the workforce which in turn stagnates and reduces wages due to supply and demand women s financial support has a time limit while men are expected to finically support their partner and family for the rest of their life weather they divorce or not alimony child support which is almost always awarded to women through the unjust family courts everyone says till death do you part but wont follow through with the decision and contract they brought into existence of their own free will were all adults here nobody was tricked or forced even in arranged marriages the women and their families have the power to decide weather to follow through or not 1 5 men men who have paternity tested children find out they are taking care of kids who their wife made them believe was their biological child and is not women do not usually face charges for this type of fraud family courts favor women tremendously men in need are under supported and left to rot hardly any men s shelters or safe spaces for men women regularly have random sexual escapades with many guys in their young years demand almost nothing of them then wait till the eggs are almost dried up to find the supportive family building type of guy then have a long list of demands for him to meet and deal with because of the trauma she obtained in her younger years all while the supportive family type of guy was toiling away working and learning how to make a larger than average amount of income probably at the detriment of his sex life
13,i had a youtube channel based on shorts about andrew tate and it got shut down outta nowhere and i had no copyright strikes spread the word,love you dude not in a gay way though,love your daily vids i have a fun game i play mainly for fact checking and trying to disprove my own ideas 1 i cannot find is which mps have been vaccination no results mmmmm,turn up the volts and kill them they will get in it s not like we want them just like the hogs in the south,1 09 dude it says strawberry morning in arabic
14,they tryna take you out my boy,u gotta take the opposite of what they say it s the opposite game with them they can t say out loud what they really feel bc it makes them look cheap and easy,omg please marry me,when he was talking about the different defenses they were looking into i was like well dont make it public the fish will find out then realized im stupid,guys who subscribe to these red pill gurus for advice on women should rather go speak to a psychologist
15,we re back,man g knowing how to maneuver w the game to make sure you win at all times is the best advice i could ve ever got,listen with intent of understanding beautifully said and so lacking today thanks for that phrase stealing it,mao and the sparrows damn no one studies history anymore,10 45 is he quoting a woman on how men should act that is as bad as a man telling how women should act i prefer robert bly in his book the iron john he discusses the masculine spiritual crisis that our society was going towards and is where we are right now it isn t the patriarchy it is a spiritual issue which even women struggle with
16,we re back,mannn you been helping me,thanks a lot for bring up a link to this past interview in it s entirety i really enjoyed that great mind opening conversation you had there this was spot on,power outage enters chat,restraunts should be free if you solve their riddles three
17,sneako keep that energy ps lasan fears the candyman,this only 23,russell you seem to nail everything i listen to you talk about you are not given enough credit for your intelligence wisdom beyond your years,this guy is bluepilled,and until then dine and dash
18,ily no homo,we need your knowledge and the reminders of what we know deep down already bro never stop,like watching your older brother deep in conversation with your father what a legendary combo thanks for the top quality conversation russell,that is not taking evolution in consideration in a few generations there will be electrician carps neutralizing this barrier,i thought red pill tiktok was gonna be about topics such as wrongs of lgbt rights vaccine bad or vax is good but not entirely good praise of capitalism and actual politics i mean i guess this is part of it but i see this more as alpha male tiktok than red pill tiktok
19,trying to full kevin samuels and andrew tate shoes smart move mature it up a bit and you could be big big,it s simple women think backwards that s why they like it from the back,we have to disagree highly with peterson s assessment that masculine traits are also being suppressed in females many female characters in movies tv shows comics and video games have been de feminized which means their masculine traits are being emphasized not suppressed not sure why peterson doesn t know this maybe he isn t paying attention or why russell doesn t push back against peterson s false assertion maybe russell isn t paying attention to pop culture either and furthermore the evidence for this masculinization phenomenon and the socialcultural commentary related to it is all over youtube so there s not far to go to notice it it s right in front of your face,sadly they will end up making it into the great lakes an entire run of rivers and canals decimated for other native fish because of humans,if you watch enough work out content on instagram it starts feeding you the sad boy gym content it s actually really sad the men making the videos do seem genuinely lonely and at least they ve found exercise as an outlet the absolute dipshits commenting on the videos take the legitimate usually innocuous loneliness and make it something so toxic
20,sneako i know your not going to see this but your our last hope you need to take the crown and lead the last of us to victory of these feminists and bring back masculinity your our last hope pit on your crown and grab your sword and be our leader and lead us into battle thank you the king of masculinity,because their basically just being used to attract more girls like a porsch or a fancy car,always had a good feeling about you man good to know i was right keep up the great work,be thankful aliens haven t decided humans are like these carp an ecological disaster,well women take all of the risks when dating men and there is a huge pay gap produced purposely by females so men should pay
21,keep up the grind my guy,that may be true but a lot of times aren t women basically k wasting their life by being with toxic males,toxic masculinity is a better definition,they are already in the great lakes i worked on lake erie for years and they were there the bigger problem is the fact that detroit and various other industrial city s dumping toxic material into the lake causing massive dead zones,well screw bell hooks another fauxmenist not a feminist for saying poor men don t get rewarded for their feelings because women don t get rewarded for their feelings either men don t deserve rewards for expressing their feelings this is what nice guys expect when guys believe if they are polite to women they are entitled to having them
22,fresh home,all u hear a lot is toxic imma grown ass man tf i look like playing emotional games i got better stuff to do,love ya brother,a few weeks ago there was a silver carp that got shoked by the dnr above the electric gate not saying they are taking over but it may happen if more get through,oh no matt hussey is on this he seemed cool in a interview about his date coaching
23,king king king,you ll never win then g,yes good job hey hi,they should add some sharks to the rivers i m sure that won t cause any long term issues,idk i think the person that asked the other out should pay they planned the date and decided how expensive it would be then you can do the you can plan pay for next time
24,they hate to see it,this video unlocked my brain,you two have wonderful chemistry i get a lot out of it,spinosate box wormdead,i will read bell hooks soon
25,tate morpheus sneako neo,i m the guest star in the soap opera where your girl cheat on you,russell this an old interview why are putting up something we have already seen i can tell because you both look different than now plus your beard which i love is not grey in this old video your grey beard looks great grey is beautiful,spinosate carp in mississippi,15 12 gotta love the cod bo music in the background
26,let s get back to ittttt,what s the name of the intro track,jp 2 54 men and women are more the same than they are different rb 3 40 one of the challenges that this argument appears to be built around is a sort of hierarchy masculinity being synonymous with power rb 7 02 what is the terrible mother jp 7 04 overprotection jp 7 34 this is part of the devouring mother archetype jp 8 14 you see it in disney movies all the time in the little mermaid ursula is the devouring mother she s the witch she s the swamp dweller she s the evil queen rehashing the prevalence of mother bashing archetypes what about masculinity what about masculine archetypes the bully who threatens intimidates beats punches kicks and screams his way through life the controlling father who procreates in order to command his offspring to control their life paths who uses fear mongering tactics to weaken them enough to do so the family business dictator who expects his children to take over the reigns to help support his retirement near him the father step father uncle grandfather priest minister boss who think vaginas and other orifices were put on planet earth for the taking so they do take even when the answer is no the male kidnapper who locks up children in the basement for years without responsible equanimity of discussion you re just another male tag team building another word wall to bolster the masculine status quo same as it ever was,need to electrify the rio grande asap,how can you actually be sponsored by these pieces of shits
27,yaaas queen u go girrrl slaaaayyyy,lmao you re right bro,4 25 yes yes yes 10000000 times yes,obviously great pains are made to negate the human interference of introducing the carp this too seems like great costly pains,who pays for the date the one who asked or go dutch
28,yes sir,me here watching this video to find red flags and never date a guy like that,thank you two of my favorite minds and mouth,hello rio grande,welcome back to the white knight show with you host noah samsen who is also a weasle
29,free my mans,i believe in patterns not words if it walks like a b dresses like a b attitude of a b it is a b,i wouldn t but thanks for the invite,if asian carp was more like halibut or even cod there would be no problem at all,i could imagine how difficult it is to wonder about whether or not my partner is sleeping with one of her friends but that would require me to have the mindset of teenage me and fuck that guy
30,w s in the chat,i got it 7 48,now you see why we love jordan peterson,tow a light low wide barge behind the a fast boat and all those fish will just jump in,id take mens lib with a great deal of salt it s very much not a space you want to go into if your a male victim of abuse or rape it s made very clear they do not care
31,welcome home my g,as of 2021 march 18 women are now admitting to liking toxicity i just i had one tell me straight up,this is epic,they should shut the canal off completely the risk reward is way too heavy on the risk side,matthew hussey is so far from being a red pill or even of these toxic people you have on here his main focus is on taking back power i don t think you ve researched enough about him to put him on here he s a dating coach and most of what he says has merit i haven t seen anything from him be toxic so gtfo with your portly researched analysis
32,someone is gonna take this out of context,they arent good ppl and they have to hide it then no,the evolution of russell from in my opinion being insufferable a few years ago to this shining person of calm wisdom is truly amazing one of the few people who i do not always agree with yet always has a valid opinion to consider congratulations russell a good man has been made,gotta start eating them,that last clip was actually about a woman who s boyfriend wanted her to start paying for stuff and she didn t want to not about first dates not about men being required to pay
33,welcome back man missed u,steph the mannn,in my opinion jordan holds no value and never will,and what bout fishes,loving too much can be quite a bad thing even if you have the best intentions i guess you ve never read of mice and men
34,we missed you brother,no point of dating of getting in a relationship,russell don t know why but i all ways think u sit there on your own talking to your self very deeply in conversation why looking at your self in a mirror lol am i rong,cool but with how close it s been already i feel like it s going to happen eventually,the whole reaction genre on youtube is problematic and is founded in insecurity start here
35,why did sneako get suspended,what she complains about is what she love copy dat,yo russel when are you going to have teal swan on your podcast that d be cool,they should use big long nets also string them across the river in a few different places,loving too much is quite a bad thing even if you have the best intentions i guess you ve never read of mice and men
36,thought you were moving like you said in one of your vids so i didn t even check to see if they fucked with you glad to see you back man,cold truth from steph,talk to camille paglia,there is no possible way to kill off these fish now that they have been introduced right so from now to eternity we will have to do things like electric barriers because people couldn t just keep their hands off nature and not introduce an invasive species,this is so many flat out lies in this it s typical liberal fascism keep championing the people that fought for slavery
37,i love sneako,dad girl s want alot of things and it s disgusting son love dad the fuck no shows son a picture of what female s want son,what about feminity if we returned to the mother we would all be better off looking for the male to provide anything other than a method of procreation is ludicrous,what if instead we utilize how they jump out of water from being startled,25 13 they still weren t raised right what s your point
38,stay funny but be careful take brad martin advice to heart don t cry like him though work around the verbiage a little you are the revolution a bit of advice when you debate don t use phrase like don t you think then follow up with why not when you use this phrase you already lost in the eyes of the viewers regardless if your statement is true or not what you have done is give the respondent an opportunity for a statement which could be bs but that doesn t matter,is true yuh cold fi real bumboclaat star,how old is this snippet of debate am i wrong in feeling something like dejavu,it will be some pud fisherman with a bucket full of canal minnows for bait to fish lake superior that s going to get this environmental disaster started at the end of a days fishing what s left in the bucket gets tossed into the lake and were off to the races mark my words its not if they get into the great lakes its when and it will happen,23 58 well it would also be a nice thing for a woman to cook and yes many women do demand and say men have to pay what planet do you live on ever heard if he doesn t pay on the first date there would no second date bruh why are you so fake
39,happy for you,ive literally lost faith in females at this point,trust you to have a man bun whilst talking about masculinity russel,im from peoria and i didn t know this,just personally if i m the one asking someone out to a date then i m paying for it unless they insist to split it the same goes the other way around
40,you speak the truth sneako all these young people need to listen to guys like you and remain unplugged just be careful because sooner or later they ll try to cancel you they always silence the truth,can anyone let me know what was the song in the start of the video,when did this interview happen,broski are you meaning to say trucks are worse for the enviorment then a few fish,i m a women and i split the bill on the first date so my girl friends maybe you are the problem
41,glad your back do your thing we got nothing else,bro this one girl told me i know you got hoes she said as long as she is the favorite its fine,please do a video on event 201 thank you,that s what we need at border with higher output,omg the fruit animalllsssss the arabic words are actually wordplay of the fruit and animal and it s so cute omg
42,happy your back,i m naturally toxic and i been having a chick in my rotation for 2 years she just keep coming back after i dog her out,ain t you gay russell,why not place a bounty on the carp and use fishing licence taxes and other funds to fund the bounty per fish amazing how fast something can be wiped out or at least reduced to a more manageable level when money is involved,i kinda like the strawberry elephant
43,where does sneako stream cuz i cant find his streams on youtube only parts of the stream like this video can anybody help,i used logic on this woman and she got all up in her feelings and called me bad,now i m confused i paid the sign up on luminary just so i could hear your podcast and i found that luminary sucks other than your podcast there are no other worthwhile podcasts on there what s the bottom line here where should we subscribe to hear your full podcasts going forward,they really should just close the canal most of these goods can be loaded on rail cars no congestion eventually something will get through and the lakes will be ruined forever,if you need to cut out your partners friends it means that you don t trust either your partner its friends or both why then why would you date someone you don t trust with friends with wouldnt trust
44,freedom of speach strikes again are u on rumble,___,how refreshing ive 3 grown bought up alone all flew the nest doing very well extremely independent agree as 1 daughter is pro footballer across the pond and another 1 coming up the ranks would love to get stuck on a lift with you two,3 32 duck goes under in the background and never resurfaces,5 11 mista steal yo gurl
45,let s go,who hurt you,such a guide you have became this was a beaut,simple solution get rid of the fish and free fertilizer build buoys that ride behind the boats that are like 20 feet of putting nets in between them drive the boat up and down the river does the fish jump out of the water they land in the net behind the boat as you see in every video jump from the sides landon the nets you catch hundreds of carbs by driving up and down the river not harsh come on people,i love this guy but i can t take him serious with the arc teryx on
46,the king has returned,so don t give a shit or control her i m confused,don t forget the story of lilith as well adam s original eve,why not use giant nets at different positions to prevent the fish from going through and the nets can be used like a opening bridge of sorts when a boat needs to go by doesn t this electrocution thing seem like an overkill,so if i pay the bill i get to peg you that s their logic
47,stop watching them,not giving a shit is controlling her,dude talk about the exxon exposed story that s the real news,to say it s america im surprised they haven t got snipers watching the river,mathew hussey is actually a feminist that clip kinda taken out of context he gives good dating advice to women
48,don t let the yt police catch u again,it seems like the more i treat my ex bad the more she come back i never understand that,hey man i love your work we have the same personalities types very interesting love the way you articulate spread great knowledge and wisdom,where can i find this electric water,the tom and jerry stuff had me cracking up
49,we was screamin free you till its baccwardzz,shawty loves toxic men so they have something to post of social media thats why i scare off some women becuz im laid back drama free and focusing on my business that help me weed out the bad ones,i think we as humans need to have some sort of toughness in us regardless if you are male or a female or transgender or whatever gender you are we need to take pride in what we do and always want to improve and build discipline,ya no terrorist thanks just a idea to give people in recreational waters,i agree that a lot of men are toxic and the mano sphere is a problem that being said if this many men are agreeing with sentiments like women don t care about your problems or you will be emotionally punished by women for being vulnerable maybe that s something we should actually address it just seems strange how hesitant we are to entertain the idea that misandry by women in certain areas maybe are also part of patriarchy
50,where s your rumble,304s are backwards lol shit i started laughing after i connected a few dots,1950 s america is what it should be that s my opinion women are masculine now and men feminine look at the low cut shorts and skinny jeans that are trendy for men absolutely feminine look at women acting like hyenas and pit bulls,grew up in the peoria area we would get jet skis and john boats and shoot the carp with shotguns when they jumped out of the water good fun,noah also gets wrong about the second clip because its not about not expressing you feelings as a man you can but not in ways where the woman would percieve you as a red flag theres a limit one should try to make a first date as fun and positive as possible
51,plug the rumble dawg,i heard that girl told me all she wants is good sex multiple orgasms not acted on it though on mgtow vibes at the moment,men are under attack take a ship for example that is crashed on a deserted island all traditional gender roles will naturally appear again,u can t close it off temporarily,17 30 i find it hilarious that he talks this bs over a christian song
52,glad you out bro,a 304 is a hoe for those who struggling with that lol,youtube has a very close to 50 50 gender split which is easy to simply google,this was so interesting thanks,how dare you clock portlandia so accurately sincerely a former portland oregonian
53,let s get back to it sneako,dang man this is so crazily true,this video is not loading are there some blue haired staffers at youtube messing with content they do not approve of,so anyone can just release two carps in the great lake and kill the industry,you know tom and jerry are best friends my closest friends try to murder mutilate and displace me from my home all the time man what rascals they are
54,my brother please then i hope you will interact with surat al rahman by sheikh nasser al qatami 2017,i love the red doorag,two smart respectful men,bro i know my phone is listening we randomly talked about this is my english class lecture,objectively correct answer to the paying for dates question whoever asked the other out on a date should pay the end that s it you psychopaths
55,nick is still trying to ban your channel over a joke,don t know how i stumbled upon this but let me tell anyone watching this and listening to this you will never understand a woman women who like toxic men have been abused by their fathers and look for validation from people who either abuse them or ignore them like their fathers stop feeling pity for urself because you can t get the 10 you want and stop obsessing over these kinds of videos first of all be clean kind and have a good personality you can get a clean kind and good woman then trust me when i say this ur not an alpha male if you even have the word alpha male in ur vocabulary,bruh your message is reaching the masses masculinity is now a currency you can see it every day,this is just crazy,relationship are founded and based on trust not insecurities but i would love to hear why the alpha chad male who spit fact argue why my take is bad
56,welcome back g,brah you only 22 thought you was bout 26,russell i love you like a older brother although the man bun looks stupid,electricity resistant carp will make it through,that maplestory background music lol
57,yesss hell yeah bro keep em coming,she a simp for me but i ain t simp for her bih loves me bruh,so he can talk about the devouring mother and the good feminine archetype but he pushes back on people talking about toxic masculinity,what if i catch some carp and release it into the lakes unless you pay me one million dollars,okay i hate it when people act like women don t have it easier when it comes to sex or getting into a relationship i mean i hate alpha males they re dumb but women always have it easier when it comes to getting into relationships and having sex who basically who they want to if a woman sees someone they find attractive at a bar she is more then likely going to be able to go home with them rather then a man finding someone attractive and going home with her i don t care if a woman wants to be with 1000 men in one night but she more then a man will be able to do that
58,welcome home,thats how it should be bro,these men don t seem masculine to me and that s great it s just the same reason we don t trust a thin chef we don t trust skinny weak effeminate emotional whiners like peterson and brand these are people easily outmanned by anything their own perception of masculinity is off to begin with believe it if you must but strong people don t need it to handle you,over fishing is a big problem in other places can t you just over fish the carp,some of the criticism against women that red pill men talk about is valid women do cheat lie and abuse men when men come together to warn other men of these horrible women to avoid how are they now incels implying that any time a man criticizes a woman he s automatically a incel does not lead to any positive outcomes abusive women deserve to be called out for their horrible behavior and not praised for it
59,youtube is going to eventually get canceled,it be like that,it sounds like they struck a nerve everything ok bro,all this effort goes toward a stupid fish but the border is wide open electrify that,my wife made us dinner tonight i did the dishes does that mean she s going to leave me because she didn t submiiiiiit to me
60,welcome back king lol,everything that you said in this video describes my last relationship smh i was such a bitch and it makes me so mad,it s sad that peterson cannot simply answer any questions otherwise people could easily twist his words on himself we are moving away from true conversations by complicating it and coming up with more words we cannot have a simple language cause there is to much truth in it and everyone is lying so here comes more complex words,as usual this solution along with other deterants that the so called experts come up with did not work either because they were implemented to late or not thought out properly we are finding these carp in the great lakes your corps of engineers have failed again if the truth be known the asian carp is producing a form of income for a lot of americans and that is more important a lot of talk as usual make it sound like your are doing everything that can be done and fooling everyone once again,he literally debunked nothing
61,bro it s crazy that your 23 and i m 22 bro you make me wanna get started on youtube and just start sun sorta content bro keep up the work bro if you get canceled trust me the viewers will fight,when i was about your age steph i had a coworker say she just wanted me for a digging stick idk if that will ever happen again lol,it could be that young men are coming to youtube precisely to find people like jordan peterson,me on my way to take 15 fish with me to the grand lakes,i just smoke weed to deal with the crippling loneliness xd
62,this fuckin sucked,to all the guys watching have fun with women but be careful on which one y all choose too start a family with,or any other source of good information since for many the father figure might be missing at home if masculinity and mastery are subjects of interest to you i invite you to explore the videos shared on the mastery order channel to challenge yourself with some ideas about manhood and to become the kind of man you would admire we can only better ourselves together as men among men so i invite you to use what i share and of course give your own opinions so that others can benefit from them as well looking forward to your points of view all the best to you,hey i live there,you think these guys would still think their if i m paying for the date you owe me sex theory is still valid if they were out with their dude friend and he s like aye man drinks for everyone my treat and then immediately started unzipping their pants like oh well i m paying for drinks so you have to suck my cock what you thought i d just buy you a drink to be nice like why is it so hard to imagine that an interaction with a woman could be non transactional or for anything other than sex when that s how all their male friendships already work
63,honestly at this point youre building a like minded community fucking awesome,wellllllll i had a woman tell me she wanted to have fun and get fuck then talking about omg i can t believe i said that i took full advantage of it,two of my favourite people,seems kind of inevitable that carp will end up in the great lakes eventually,the grown men realm sounds so much worse than the shadow realm and the phantom zone
64,why are microwaves bad,check out the story of sampson from the bible,female to male ratio on youtube is 54 to 46,survival of the fittest carps win humans need to stop messing around with nature,this is literally what happens when you don t punish the class bully for several millenia
65,keep doing what you doing my g masculinity is facing extinction and it s our duty to school shit people about it with all the tools we have,ey steph they always been that way from the beginning good stuff man,kathryn nails it in a one line comment below j peterson is a bit of a sullen guide to the weak men kathryn mentions,thanks yet again greatest generation,that wall is whiter than me
66,according to current research soy has neither a positive nor a negative effect on testosterone levels the estrogen level also remains unaffected,to the thing that they dew,you look like a woman with a beard and you act gay so,i can t imagine the energy needed to operate this,noah in the arcy
67,because being a man is too hard that s why all they bi es want to switch their genders lol,this is amazing life saving content i m 40 found the red pill at 38 wish i had this advice when i was 16 but at least i can share this with my son also got your patreon,there is a spectrum of masculine feminine traits in both sexes it is enforcing certain characteristics on each that creates inner conflict maternal overprotection is no worse than disinterest or abuse peterson should know that gender change is a result of the need to conform to stereotypes over 90 of male gender reassignments the most common are performed on those who worked in highly masculine jobs as a disguise if the world stopped trying to homogenise gender expectation it would probably cease to be an issue when female movie stars began wearing trousers there was little reaction it is now unquestioned if a man wears a dress it is an abnormal expression of masculinity this shows a huge disparity of gender freedom both masculine feminine traits which have an overlap can be toxic that is the desire to assert yourself over another all of these issues are all bound up in the dogma of religion you should be what we tell you to be has spread into various forms of indoctrination religion remains an integral part of our society it has served humanity badly on every level,please stop saying carps its asian carps common carp have nothing to do with this,what is the red pill
68,ayeeeee idk who those people even are but i know who you are from tik tok and i m glad i found your youtube,yo steph next time you go live bro ima call in got some good questions bro,i m saying this everywhere but just wanted to let you know jordan petersons name is inside a sexual trafficking book i m not sure if it s this peterson but it talks about a peterson in his younger years it s written by a canadian woman so unless there s other jordan petersons then it might not be him but there s a chance it might be him page 60 titled victim a feminist manifesto of a fierce survivor good luck if it s peterson everyone s talking about in this world y all are glorifying a contributor to sexual trafficking,us army corp of engineers,honestly if your gf wont submit to you dont be her bf i could get like if you have hard rules have them no problem with that hope u find someone who likes that too then he whips out no male friends i was thinking more along the lines of i wanna top in bed lmaoooo
69,10 48 sneako bugging,it s funny getting them on camera that s not me it s my twin lol if i get cheated on and i stay that s danger bitch,jordan peterson is a very common name so idk,they couldn t figure out a lake or a river but we re gonna stop or slow global warming,i m empathetic and caring but in like a hot and sexy villainous kind of way good job noah you just described every woman s true ideal man
70,they are all brainwashed by their leader drew buffalo who looks like the grinch as a drag queen,good passion bro,this was great and all gents but did you have to stop talking really interesting stuff thanks for bringing a sane little corner of the internet into being,look at history and the us government has done more to destroy the environment then any evil company,taking it out of context and distorting facts this is your essence
71,i took therapy and it s a business where they profit from you being stuck and emotional but the biggest red flag is that female therapist out number men especially in low income communities it s about making men more emotional like women that s the woke agenda,i wanted to dislike your video because i said oh he s saying that so harshly but i can t dislike it because you are correct the man that i love with my whole heart is the man that my friends couldn t understand why i was talking to him they said he was ugly he was nerdy he was built nice but his legs are a little skinny etc etc but none of that mattered to me because i saw the king in him i saw that he was a good man not a toxic dude but a true honest good man just in the way he approached was different i loved our conversations our dates and just him in general and i m not content with him i m happy and i spend every moment trying to reciprocate that back to him but my friends are still doing the same and mad about it but they refuse to change so for the ramble but i just wanted to say you are right and i m sharing your video with them because they need to hear it,almost everybody who watches youtube is male stop talking shit,what stops someone from just walking up to the lake with a bunch of carp and letting them free,2 4 tons on wren im just poor
72,i can t these blue pilled male feminist soy boys who s only strategy to getting laid is pandering to women being so woke it s cringing,so your not happy with ur nice man,a large majority is,are a series of nets not an option due to potentially hindering flow because couldn t you have stages of nets that are lowered and raised to allow barges to pass through but there s always a point where at least one is fully up to avoid passage of fish,dude stop being such a pussy the girl in the room literally said he has to pay so stop referring to your friend group and the types of people your around to negate his
73,people who hate sneako haven t watched a stream,damn stephanie you cold as hell,rising respect for rb in recent months both as an interviewer and his obvious interest in parsing through our complicated civ here though he s overthinking it while i agree with peterson s comment that rb s hypothesis warrants thought there s a simpler explanation for boomers especially and carried over into xrs the prevailing assumption by the ad market decision makers has been that regardless that a household only have one income and it was brought in by the man the woman still made most of the day to day purchasing decisions was assumed to use most of the products more often after spending a couple of decades with that template and as commercials became more sophisticated were got more humor men have typically been the comic foils in mass media though there are notable exceptions however even in the 90 s maybe due to something like simpsonifocation or albundying lol we started seeing a lot of the boyfriend husband father as the oaf idiot simpleton like alllll the time,a very nice video,i feel so bad for these guys i ve had some low times but i m glad i didn t go there
74,shneako s face when he listens to the soy explanations,i just typed 304 in my calculator and turned it upside down,trickery 1970 hooray women you are now free to earn money and be independent 2010 women sorry it now needs two full time wages to feed ti family and pay your accommodation 2022 families the children are no longer yours but the property of the state to indoctrinate attack on masculinity women the family gender your freedom,0 02 weeee,i think many of the red pill content out there are poor attempts to try to create a healthy public discourse for men s issues like the fact that june is only seen as pride month but so many people forget it is also men s mental health awareness month it seems like a lot of mens concerns are just pushed to the side or ignored completely and if we truly mean progress for all or progress for none well then
75,l soy products pick up cooking it helps you be more healthy and it s attractive,i remember when i was younger i believed in monogamy i had this one girl she turned me out she made me drop all the girls i was talking to took me out of my flow state shit harmed me 5 6 years fk,what a joke j peterson talking about masculinity,we already have carp in michigan so there s that,it s so weird that we all agree that society s rules for upholding masculinity suck and cause of lot of stress and anger but the red pill solution is to fully lean into these rules uphold them by any means necessary give these rules more power by taking agency away from women and attack anybody who questions these rules
76,10 53 chill son lol he works out,for 22 years you seem very mature,man bun and talking about masculinity hello,i have always wanted to wake surf with a bat and just hit carp for fun,real hard cold fact advice that will shatter the fake reality you live in girls don t ever date a man who wears a cap on a daily basis as shown in this video clearly proves my point he is hiding a receeding hairline he has insecurities and will be jealous until he eventually cheats on you because he is convinced you did it first no seriously why is first dude wearing a swimming cap
77,theres nothing wrong with men becoming femenine,i feel like woman are like mini versions of lilith we definitely gta stay aware and be on point,its funny how people today confuse masculinity with how much testosterone you have in olden days a real man was a man who treated people and females with respect and dignity and acts of kindness and goodness how about the feminine in men men are born from a female body which means all men are half female too,why does the worker guy explaining the use of the fence sound like chills the number fifteen burger king guy,it s most likely a durag
78,this guy in the kingdom would absolutely shit on demons,adams first wife people not hip that be drop that knowledge man,i think your hair russell didn t help masculinity,if carp were imported in to cause this whole mess would importing predators of carp be a bad idea,the idea of change happening from within the oppressive system is so important the goal of healing is not to become ok with a shit system but to work to dismantle it i find a lot of men have done a lot of work accepting a bad hand or a shit deal and because they have gotten over it they think everyone has to also just integrate with the oppressive status quo it s kind like a sunk cost in economics they ve invested so much energy over the years into being ok with emotional unavailability that they prescribe this same journey to others as the only way out of self loathing
79,lmaooo the thumbnail,my ngga u look 29,omg what russell said about femininity being fullfilled through materialism because it s negated socially us so true emotionally neglected children and children with emotional trauma tend to have more money issues than children who weren t and that s straight from experience books and seeing a therapist lol it s crazy but true,so in order to throw a billion dollar wrench to the economy all one needs are some horny tarps and a trip to the great lakes interesting,thats literally just how all people are bite of more then they can chew get tired of it and now they have a story some do and don t care to hear perspective and experience
80,bruh i drink soy cause i m allergic to dairy but ima start drinking dairy products and deal with the consequences cause nearly everything the dude listed was true about me,real shit,i tapped out at 5 23 i m an economist and couldn t take the philosophical nature of this conversation any longer,why are you wearing flourescent vests,if that heartbroken asshole keeps trying to force women to submit to him he s risking a vasectomy without anesthesia
81,fuck the system,steph when you say a chick is strap what do you mean,watch a documentary called the red pill enjoy,and when the carp were originally introduced i m sure that local scientists all chorused how the carp would solve all their problems and that the science was sound,i ll submit to a man over his dead body
82,no word of a lie who is sneako reacting to,this literally happened to me last week with an old friend from high school she hit me with the i liked you for so long like bitch no tf u didn t,4 06 brussel point of advertising sexualizing females to the use for consumers is so true look at the female celebrities like britney spears madonna doja cat dua lipa nicki minaj and many more in the past including transgender celebrities this list is not in order by the way the music industry abused this type of advertisement to maintain their power sadly they were mainly males that makes a lot of good males look bad,i just pumped out their septic lmaoooo it s on old romeo road in romeoville illinois,my arm hurts
83,3 23 i m stronger i m smarter i m better i am betterrr,bruh i had a very attractive girl in my customer service class say if i can t control you i don t want you at the time it didn t really ring any bells but now that shit makes a lot of sense,two good men,the human mind is curious i think the population would benefit greatly,ohhh the paying thing can be so awkward i like to split the bill especially on the first date but some blokes really get offended as if i had emasculated them by wanting to pay my share and keeping in mind that a lot of the power men have over women is connected to women s financial dependancy created by sociaty on men yea maybe demonstrating your financial independancy does hurt their sense of masculinitiy i guess a very clear red flag immedeately settles the question if there will be a second date or not good filter
84,don t forget hops in beer contain a lot of estrogen as well,all of a sudden i felt that part a lil too much,masculinity is as individual as the male born to it and is limited only by male imagination for example a male acting feminine is a form of masculinity just as a female acting masculine a form of feminism the intellectual debate is purely around defining acceptable male social behavior not what true masculinity is because we don t accept all male behavior as masculine which is a false definition,what happens if some dude just takes a few carp and drives over to great lakes and throws them in,i feel your anxiety through the screen hot and nerve racking we need to relax geez
85,bro i got man tits n ion even eat soy wtff,teach me sensei i fuck with this,the holy spirit is the feminine it is very feminine it is powerful yet motherly toward humanity jordan needs to know that,is this dude serious bro cuyahoga river ohio loaded with carp lake erie loaded so all the great lakes are full of carp,i m just here for the sarcasm and dry humor
86,harden up mate and keep doing you don t let these pussies get to you,i knew i wasn t trippin,i respect the shit out of russell brand for having these conversations cause they need to happen props to him for being attentive and wanting to have a genuine understanding of it love it russell keep it going,lake erie is loaded dude i catch carp there all the time,can someone please explain the line about zelenskyy
87,people obsessed wit u sneako ay we got 800k in the army still growin the femboys are angry all liberal men are cat boys,what is a 304 man i m from germany,lol this is brilliant two eunuchs talking about masculinity russel brand i wish i was bi sexual and a life long drug addict and jordan peterson who sobs like a little girl at the slightest discomfort come on you can do better than this,god forbid those carp get into lake erie and destroy the walleye,as someone who s also living with terminal centrism i m really starting to dig this channel
88,honestly i might got a soy latte cuz i wanna know what all the hype is about i ll take one for the team i will report back and tell y all wtf a soy latte tastes like kinda scared ngl,turn it upside down on the calculator,it is so nice seeing two people who genuinely respect each other and are not out for eachothers throats,ah improving things is again prevented by monetary interests at least i hope that carp is tasty,i love all these cishet men that apparently know exactly what every human with a vagina thinks
89,let them talk because you re the topic and that s what gives them views what they do is piggyback off your name,first time i ever heard the term 304,russel is so chill and eager to have his ideas questioned so funny when he s like what do you think i made it up really we all can learn so much from this conversation on how to grow and let our ideas be questioned,all of that and any human could just dump thoses fish to ruin everything,research shows _consistently_ that feminists have happier relationships and more satisfying sex lives sources in comment below i can t link to the studies as youtube will bury hide it any comment with that many links
90,why is everyone talking about literal soy in the comments last time i checked a soyboy was a dude that gossips and acts like a straight bitch for a career and it shows that these people in the comments are all pretending to be hell bent on natural soy as if they aren t trying to make it obvious that they need to cope and grow some fucking balls,steph goat,for some 20 years i was a single mother and breadwinner and found myself having to do battle with many people and circumstances in order to be both mother and provide for my 2 daughters my friends at the time being quite esoteric folks told me i was too masculine that i needed to work on being more feminine my point of view was that when you need to do battle probably a war negotiation or a battle axe is going to serve me better than whatever more feminine means now that my daughters are adults independent and professionals in their own careers my friends comment on not knowing how i did it balancing career motherhood children with learning disorders multiple therapists teachers who did not understand and an acrimonious ex husband various legal battles he threw at me financing all the extra therapies plus everything 2 young people in today s world need for all of 2 decades the answer is i had to go viking on it all my daughters were unhappy when i was clearly not as available as they would have liked growing up but i made sure we had plenty of family times and time out together in nature in the little leisure time we had now they understand the example and picture i gave them they are fully able to embrace both masculine feminine sides to their humanness the workplace and potential partners are not particularly ready for that though they are just not your average women they have fully embraced their masculine side with being definitely women who mean business in today s world at home metaphorically speaking they are definitely not used to giving up the remote we never had that issue in a 3 woman household embracing both sides is just not comfortable for women there is still enormous stereotyping working against women being allowed to be that women are frequently punished severely at home in social groups and even quite definitively in the workplace where equality of competence should be most of tolerated,did they take the human factor into account however not talking about the barrier right now but about trolls in general people doing it for the lulz like anyone can just take the carp and drop them at the lake no,it s funny i m a anarcho leninist marxist
91,i totally agree with you men are becoming more and more feminine these days the world turning gay this gen ain t no real man left i m glad i got married to a real man who doesn t whine or complain all the time or type trash to a female and not have the balls to say a female in real life or even have the balls to talk to one they cry over the stupidest thing they start watching chicks flicks now and cry over it if you don t agree with them or feel sorry for them if they cry over it my man don t watch chick flicks he likes action movies he dosent whine or complain or cry over a chick flick movie if he decides to watch lol but he never will watch my man a manly man,respect steph,don t worry cucker is getting yall free viagra for your prob,army corps built the disaster and now is in charge of trying to fix it what s that old axiom the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result,you completely took that clip 22 30 out of context matthew hussey had a discussion with the women in his seminar if the man had to pay for a date and the women said yes so they do expect it he s wrong with his point here but what you suggest here is not what he said and he s not a redpiller so he shouldn t be on the thumbnail
92,spring water keep it natural boys,he just speaks the truth,russell lacks testosterone you can tell,americans doing what americans do best ruined the environment,i actually enjoy that youre trying to understand whats behind their reasoning and explain why it s wrong i think that s gonna help more in making people see their bullshit than when you just shout at them that theyre terrible wrong dumbies
93,collab with hamza,for all the idiots 4 h 0 o 3 e 304 means hoe,i have heard preachers preach since i was a kid and screw kids in the bathroom seen politicians call each other names in public and clap each other on the back in a private gentleman club laughing at the stupid public i don t believe anything any more not you not anyone it s all garbage the only reason i don t jump off a bridge is like patty page said i am not ready for that final disappointment men don t protect women they feed off of them,can t you use the fish animal feed fish cakes since you ve got so much u know life gives you lemons,incell logic puts the fear in me
94,lmfaooooo this man pulled up a pjw video to investigate,da truth has been spoken,it s very cute how russell brand clearly admires and respects jordan peterson s knowledge,how can birds go on the water essentially in the water but if a human does it or say treads water they die why,i see you youve played maplestory back in the day
95,sneako is the truth,never trust a 304 xd,russel is one of a few that can speak about drug abuse politics hollywood and just about anything because he jas been through the bottom and the top,me driving my car in the great lake with a cooler full of pregnant carps,hell nah my girl can t have no male friends and i won t have female friends cause if i m talking to a girl i m trying to smash
96,this guy is the next andrew tate topg,the mf og,you have to have a place at the table for the serpent i think that ties nicely into the idea of embracing your shadow and becoming a monster as jordan peterson talks about a lot good stuff,rubidiumhd gaming and blogs close,counter argument for the men should pay trope women used to not be able to get a job or obtain their own capital so they weren t really able to pay for dates so obviously the men were supposed to pay cause women didn t have anything to give that being said i like the the one who takes the other on a date should pay trope
97,one thing your 23,so that they can make false accusations when it suits them this doesnt only go for toxic men though for them soft ass betas aswell you re a conveniance,sorry i had to comment because the youtube gods decided to drop a video in my algorithms about masculinity from a dude with a man bun that s all,funny i wonder if barrior works for other invasive species trying to move north build that wall,you should also check out pop culture detective when talking about manhood and problems men face in society very enlightening
98,ur yelling at me,thanks for the wisdom my g,youtubes audience isn t 80 male but 56,if 95 percent are carp on that side why don t they wipe out that hole side and start again,that rogan wow near the beginning of the video
99,sneako i can run ur channel better and open up your mind watch days of noah,truth keep going steph,i love me a strong manly man glad i married before these newer cheaper made models,bro i gotta wake up for class in 3 hours why am i watching this,first guy sounds like an incel tow mater
100,wow thank you,damn this video hit the mark about a 3 weeks ago i finally smashed this girl i met 3 years ago who then went cold on me 2 months later my nice dumbass chased after her with nothing in return so i went dry on her after that everything you said is true af,brand is clever especially given his lack of education but the limits of his intellect are clearly evident in the company of a mind like peterson s just an observation not a condemnation i d likely seem no better,ad god did not put those dang fish in north america he did not put permanent elctrified fences either blackout or flooded power systems means it will at some time fail due to natural disasters occurring,they want a sexual woman who doesn t have sex if she has sex before you she s for the streets but if she isn t good in bed she s a prude please make up your minds if she s to sexual she only wants sex and nothing else but if she isn t sexual with you enough she is cheating but at the same time you as a man can have sex and are entitled to it
101,facts and it s becoming disgusting and gross western men are so feminine,i ve seen heard plenty of females say they don t smash on the first night so they don t seem like a hoe,it s bloody lovely,what if some one carry that fish to it,i can agree with him not about the being straight part but women 333
102,you go on this whole rant about how they re boring but you do the exact same thing and spam fucking sound effects and watch itscomplicated because you re not entertaining enough to live stream respect on ur main channel though you just need to wake up and have some self awareness,my girl and i had our biggest fight ever followed by me fuckin the absolute life out of her she knows women want me it has a hell of an effect on the psyche,russel brand i would love to chat with you wow the things you say are so on point deep beyond boundaries you say the things im thinking and you are not afraid of it you put words on thoughts and experiences i have about society and life and just deliver it in a nice package its just like magic you are so intellectual and everytime i listen to you i feel validated awesome,maybe this could be used in the rio grande to prevent anyone from crossing into the united states from mexico hmmm,the arabic memes at the beginning
103,sooooooooooooooooooooooo when you gonna fight brandon buckingham,man just been subscribed for 3 days every vid i have watched ive learned something new thank you for exposing me for the blue pill man ive always been and doing what your doing to help turn blue man into the man they are purposed to be,it was a bit car crash tv but there was a programme a while back called young dumb and living with mum which stuck a group of 18 yr olds in a house together and monitored them most all were coming from homes where their parents were in despair over their childs laziness or inability to cope with the most basic tasks it was truly shocking to see 18yr olds asking for advice on how to heat up a tin of beans or turn on a washing machine it suggested the kind of parenting jordan speaks of here i don t want to point fingers people can slip into habits or make a simple mistake that just snowballs but really if a child from a supposedly stable home is reaching 18 with no idea how to make a meal for itself or wash its own clothes the parents have to take a look at themselves you are not helping your children by smothering them with care and leaving them unable to take care of themselves even if you re rich and think you ll always be able to pay someone to do things for you you should still know how to take care of essential needs never say never,god forbid those carp get into lake erie and destroy the walleye,tbh i agree with the overall sentiment of the video but i feel like you re showing a lack of understanding of the world
104,the redpill and masculinity is spreading like wildfire even the people who try to controll us by controlling the media and the narrative are failing to stop the rise of men more and more wake up everytime thanks to the like of shneako andrew tate undead chronic ribby the party frog etc,flips 304 upside down mind blown,woman here you both open my eyes and mind to new angles on old issues,poor fish didn t escape muricans greed,that clip between 23 and 24 minutes was really manipulatively edited if you watch the whhhoollleee clip the woman in the audience actually expected the man that she s dating to continuously pay for her for every date and said verbatim he should pay because he s the man the guy on stage was totally within his right to say if you don t offer to pay you weren t raised right if you don t pay that s fine but if you don t even offer to pay you clearly have full financial expectation on the other person not cool
105,people like shneako and andrew tate gets hated by the weak because theyre jealous of the strong bring back masculinity stay true to yourself no matter how angry it makes the world their opinions have no value only listen to the people you look up to and ignore the people you look down to,what woman say they want is oxymorons,what if the wounded masculine is healed with kindness and understanding not judgement,as a fisherman i really don t want these carp in the great lakes,second guys talks like a skyrim npc but with lower quality animation
106,i dont know sneako except from that hamza roast but i think andrew tate reawakened sneakos masculinity lmao,she look at you like you crazy damn that hit a nurve bro,jordan spouts a lot of shite that he does not back up quick google search shows youtube user base shows users as 55 percent male and 45 percent female not the 80 20 his viewership reflects and which he claims mirrors the youtube user base this is not correct he is not correct about a lot of things it s fine to make assertions and conclusions but hedge a little bit man throw in a caveat or two you just look dumb spouting cock sure inaccuracies,maybe they should do this at the border,hold on that blue pill for dear life
107,i m anti woke and pro soy i had a family member get sick and started deep researching anti cancer diets soy is a good anti cancer and pro immunity food the phytoestrogen in soy actually counters human estrogen that s why studies on women with breast cancer who consumed the most soy had higher survival rates it blocks the actual estrogen it also is associated with lower levels of ed and impotence,where you from,toonski plays i very much doubt i will find a difference did you even bother to look,never in my life have i seen fish just jumping in and out the water like that loving life like they re dolphins,give you a lolly give you a lolly
108,yea for women not man bots cant even listen to the dam video,when i had a girl the amount of attention i got from other women was astronomical verses me being single,this interview is from 3 years ago your stats are from 2021,how much would it hurt to jump in,agree with all this obviously what s wrong with no jumper
109,this is actually true also broccoli is good to produce t and dht,that beat in the intro is cold bro,i love jordan learning to love you too russel,they should defiantly do this at the boarder,na man the tankie internet sphere is no longer that unified since those americans started to join fortunately i am on the global south so no problems we all hate the west
110,ayy bro take yo meds,steph i ve gone cold and never been more free thank you bro you re faithful,we really need masculinity in this crazy feminist era we re living in men need help and guidance not being put down by evil feminists you go guys,i love how human intervention causes harm is used as an explanation for why these thriving carp are a bad thing and yet putting an electric fence underwater to direct entire ecosystems of fish at a price tag surely of 10s of millions of dollars per year of taxpayer money likely more is somehow not a human intervention that causes harm who cares if the carp are dominating the ecosystem they look edible to me as far as getting hit in the face by a flying fish i guess you would have to stop going 40 miles an hour down the lake 16 hours a day how tragic imagine all the tubers and water skiers who would be so gravely oppressed by the evil carp were they allowed to roam free and pursue their natural fate and destiny let me guess the author also believes climate change is going to sink florida and england by 2030 the gaslighting never ends the real victims here are people living in the area who have to hear the noise pollution of incessant recreational boating at high speeds and the taxpayers who continue to be robbed deaf by the perpetually expanding inefficient ineffective misdirected largest most profligate corporations on earth known as governments,i love tom and jerry
111,cuz gay,could not be more true,i wish you could get joaquin phoenix on the podcast,there are carp in the great lakes i used to catch them in the 70 s,could you react to some more of matheus videos i actually used to watch some of them when i was single but i don t think i learn a thing would be interesting to hear a woke man s opinion
112,what about cow s milk that stuff literally contains estrogen,music at the intro is my track 9 9 9 on soundcloud btw if anyone else wanted to know,fk this is good shit gents,so someone could just take a carp and bring it to the lakes and everyone is screwed,are straight people okay
113,so what foods are we supposed to eat because these fitness nuts always say that but want us to buy a 100 dollar course just to tell us what to eat like no gang,it feels like he sat me down while im eating and telling me how these females b,i think that s a great point russel about society sexualizing femininity and idolizing that it makes me think that as women funnel there feminine behavior and nature in that way as a consequence they don t funnel or nurture it in there relationships or to there partner properly there taught to express there feminine nature sexually to society and also through social media there relationships then lack the feminine nurturing it needs,in 10 years we ll have electrical carp zapping everything,i m a cool guy just being a dude
114,ok shneako you took it far because some moms breast can make enough milk for the average baby to need so they need to resort to formula but hey i love you and i love what you do to change masculinity,women are beautiful but takes time in energy to keep her happy but even then she still be looking for something else because she don t know what she wants for guys we have to stay on a purpose don t let these women use you or play you because there more manipulative then guys women are super complicated there not logical like my boy said they go based on feelings not logic i ve sleeped with plenty of wifes and girls in relationships in let me tell you they don t give a fuck about there dude s and half of them act like they like you to get what they can from out of you as in even a baby child support it s sad but it s true but hey always be there for the lady s but whatever you don t try to save them because they don t want to be saved hope that helps,so feminine energy is equated with the demonic,we could ensure the safety of the largest freshwater lakes on the planet but money so we won t,i noticed a lot these channels only grow larger anytime anytime you make a video about them thank you
115,tate for president,ams clone he just rebranding the same content no hate tho,jordan talks like a whiny little boy it s quite distracting,whats wrong with carp it is tasty,woah i never thought i d encounter the arab twitter fruit animals meme here
116,easy answer bc it doesnt matter lol,this is true i been toxic very toxic with my girl she always comes back almost as if she likes this shit the bedroom is a major factor for women i feel i give her the fuck of her life every single time rough,i know more women then men are watching youtube,how about a net,when men keep their feelings to themselves that isn t patriarchy by definition it doesn t oppress women in any way it s in fact anti feminist to expect women to deal with men s problems it s bad to share your feelings and insecurities it forces them especially women to do emotional labour go to therapy instead
117,if my wife s name was worth a shit ton of money i would take it like koch,steph please do a video about will smith allowing his wife to get dug out by august alsina it s in the news right now g smfh,good conversation,import predators too,thanks for the portland shout out i think
118,whats wrong with microwaving food,they all talk they love to complain negative attentions is better than no attention they all got daddy issues,i remember years ago i thought russel brand is a bumbling idiot now i have nothing but respect for the guy,toxins scientists wonder why so many sea animals are dead on beaches,bro the editing is soooooo clean
119,also heating thing up in plastic containers is not the healthiest either,because they all have an ego they want what they can t have they want social status and high money this man is right they say lies,masculinity can t be toxic there is just masculinity and different levels of it,it s the great lakes not ocean smart guy,i swear i would pay to see these black male alpha males never make another video they are absolutely insane delusional and disgusting like i m so tired of hearing their crap
120,it heats uneven as fuck get you a toaster oven infinitely better,steph what if you have a girl should you still have girls in your rotation,i don t think it has as much to do with masculinity than it does with personality and the shadow i think that men and women that don t see their own shadow are far more likely to be toxic in general letting go of pride is the first step in reducing your biological and psychological impulses and judgements,what s up broski,no tom jerry saddest moment ever
121,sneako has been leveling up the past couple months he just keeps getting better and better,these 304s ain t loyal,why does jordan peterson always get badly lit,why not,great video
122,me who eats sushi with soy sauce,aye ima start using 304,i feel like russell s real life goal is to use every single word in the dictionary waiting till he gets to zebra,i never heard of this before now thanks for sharing this,matthew hussey was literally on an australian dating show coaching women on how to date men
123,youre getting better at speaking off the cuff,i read somewhere that hell is filled with more women than men i wondr why that may be hmm,that would be eminem lol,magikarp has evolved into an even more annoying fish,men marry who they want to because its the men who propose women have to wait to get a proposal so its a fact that women are never going to marry the one they want is that what he means
124,damn i eat soy sauce with my rice,you look like you re trying to look pretty in your thumbnail,i love these archetypal stories with jordan peterson they re his most fascinating tales it s just like greek mythology for the 21st century,well a bird could catch a fish and accidentally release it on the other side of the barrier,one of the many many sad things about guys like this is they don t seem to understand the concept of genuine connection with anyone or like imagine the concept of only having sex with people you want to have sex with
125,this is why it is better for the women to stay home and cook for their family so they are putting the right food in their body,steph you spoke so many facts in this video,i d love to see a lauren southern russell conversation,more pollution resulting from closing the canal is idiotic electrified trains can easily replace the barges the only problem is is that the billionaire corporations are unwilling to invest in the electrical infrastructure along the existing freight rail lines barges cause both air pollution and water pollution,we should start the man cube
126,soy is in almost everything,who watch stephiscold and mjgetright,glad i found this good talk,how does this stop someone from catching 20 karp from the river and dumping them into the lake,so women lead men on take all their money and that s ok
127,i have a feeling you watched so many lives that sucked and you thought i can do that and actually be interesting so you did it and you re right you re not just a body on the screen with nothing to say your content is interesting,im toxic asf in a good way though,russell sounds like the one guy in drama class who actually cared about the lesson but had absolutely no acting skills whatsoever,at one point americans will learn this fence did more damage and created a new set of problems quick fix economy,women play mind games 10 times what men do
128,it s sickening the amount of guys i speak to in socials that give a weak ass handshake my handshake isn t the best but i always give a fairly firm one you can really tell someone s testosterone levels from their handshake pressure,5 52 lmaoooo,it s so cute how starsruck russell is here 3,why don t fish get harmed but humans do,bro all u fucking do is insult the creators u don t actually show any studies or any evidence that back any claims if u even made any
129,you need help man lol losing yo mind,speak on the jada and will situation well that s if you know about it,very refreshing conversation,stray electric currents can destroy boat props and axles how far away do you need to keep your boat to not have to worry about it,go back to playing marvel games baby boy
130,ludwig aka c ckwig,the term 304 is dumb asl easier to just say hoe why was this term created,when i had my babies i was raising children now that they re children i m raising adults if i spend 18yrs raising children then i m not doing what s best for them if it weren t for jordan peterson s wisdoms around single mothers and the balance between masculinity and femininity in myself and the development of my son s and daughters i d have suffocated the relationship with my eldest son in particular years ago,i caught a huge carp in lake superior 25 years ago,do you have any studies and evidence that support your claims
131,kids exposing there parents secret agendas on youtube should be the ones cancelled they can t even do they job right,fellas y all think this is something shit my g hit the patreon steph always keeps it real attracts real,i just want to say i love this comment section as much as i love the video it s actually hard to find an argument or a hateful comment this is what the whole internet should be like,co2 would create dead zones making a lock system in conjunction with electricity would be probably more efficient,u a blue pilled beta white knight soy boy
132,bruh just admit these ducks likes watching curvy women takin this pipe and damn near sound like victims,men speak overtly and women speak covertly that s why us guys always think woman are confusing but they aren t confusing they just speak in a different language men will say it straight up how it is and women will speak in actions she hot and cold with you just means another dude entertaining her if a girl really want you she won t risk losing you if she ehh about you she ll show that if she wants to hang she will if she wants to f ck she will if she makes you wait 5 dates in for it than it ain t worth it move on,2 of my favorite people,pokemon please remove electric weakness from bird pokemon,this video is ignorant
133,bro tate was banned i think you are the next i d definitely follow you on rumble,it s hard af to find love,umm the evil queen stepmother architype is evil because overprotective did we read the same fairytales growing up i distinctly recall a poisoned apple also the 4th element is either the female or the devil yup that sounds like our mythology one of the first things i learned growing up was that female bad and male good you run like a girl you throw like a girl you hit like a girl girls don t understand math 3d spatial reasoning insert smart topic here i don t think the phrase toxic masculinity means that masculinity is toxic and i think it is disingenuous to imply that this is what is meant being an a hole is toxic but that a holery is acceptable even lauded if you are a masculine man,did you just say carp have no natural predators where s my rod i ll show you,yeah i m totally not gonna listen to all those guys and their experiences and just listen to this one guy men stop being slaves
134,top g,please make a video on the topic of kids and if you see yourself having kids and how you d manage that situation,they promote masculinity in women and feminity in men the result is both sides are miserable,ahh yes the us army vs fish,yea cuz they re bozos you should understand that what their saying is stupid no one should have to point it out
135,bro ur getting banned younger top g,wish i found this channel a month ago but it s never late to learn and get better in future,no matter how physically strong and masculine you are the masculinity is toxic when you are emotionally weak that s a more feminine quality and if you haven t accepted that and aren t in balance that is when you begin to mask your insecurities with strength and needing to dominate the same thing can happen in women then when they ve had trauma from men and feel like they aren t protected by men and can t be comfortable in their femininity around them that s when they feel like they need to to everything a man can do but it s exhausting,hi i m johnny knoxville and this is the thrilling dive ooohhhhhhhhh,did the first guy really say no big bro what in the sweet home alabama is this
136,if hopsin and brandon hampton had a kid together thats sneako,yo steph what s your email i have a question about the program,the way you ve put all that i ve never thought of before but yeah totally agree with you with regards toxic masculinity when a man is emotionally weak and uses his physical strength presence to dominate people it always causes harm such as men who recently have been in the news who have been spiking women at nightclubs with needles as a male i believe it is our responsibility to guide other men away from seriously harmful behaviours which ruin society just as women to guide other women with respect to certain issues,what if a jokester terrorist took like 10 of these and throw them in lake michigan or whatever,dudes thinking i will owe them sth if they pay is the reason i will never let a date pay for my food or drinks i will fight tooth and nail to not let him pay lol that s one of the perks of dating foreigners i just quickly tell the waiter in estonian that we ll pay separately d buuuut there s the aspect of pay gap in estonia with many couples the woman simply can t afford to dine out so the choice is either he pays or they don t dine luckily i earn well for local standards so can afford to have principles lol
137,but paul joseph watson didn t say anything,they are compulsive liars you have to see them for what they are and not what you want them to be,i m sorry but did jordan peterson compare women to the devil and use harry potter and disney s sleeping beauty as justification huh,i would enlarge that canal and make sure it extends fully to the mississippi it needs to become a major trade route again chicago will prosper from this and the city needs something to stimulate its economy to break the cycle of extreme crime and poverty,you clip your fingernails so short
138,i m about to drop two different statements one is why i fuck with andrew over sneako and vice versa first off sneako has insane arrogance you can tell that in nearly every video except this one it always comes out when he s sitting there and talking by himself i live rent free in these peoples head i win every debate within three sentences they can t stop me i m better than them not the exact words of sneako but close i think he makes great points and does win majority of his debates which i also think is why many people won t debate him because they re scared of being fucked up the ass by him but again he let it get to his head which is a shame because when people get arrogant it is usually the beginning of that mans downfall now for my second point sneako approaches the topic of women a lot better than andrew and i mean a lot better andrew as we all know is very forward with the subject and is often times hypocritical like the times he has said oh yeah my girl cant cheat that s haram but i can because you think guys always fucked just one chick nahhh there are studies proving that girls would sleep around in ancient cultures and even in caveman times but go off ig andrew all ya doin is going to ruin ya public image more in my opinion sneako thinks more of women and is a lot more fair to them rightfully so keep that up my guy cause we know that is what killed andrew,they boring anyway stay on path family,russell brand this is a joke right,need this on the southern boarder rio grande,wow that first dude has deep insecurity written all over him these dudes are going die alone or with someone they manipulated into a relationship and subsequent marraige
139,yo watch more plates more dates testosteron is actually derived from soy,he don t even have waves let that sink in yall,56 of people that watch youtube are male it s not the biggest of disparities here maybe men gravitate to you more jordan because you are frequently talking about men and masculinity or maybe also that conservatives are men leaning uh duh,let the people fish for free on carps no limits,don t care more than she cares paraphrased why how what why hasn t he imprinted on her so she s trapped by her biology you got to imprint on her he told you two years ago damn don t care more than the b h does what is wrong with you this man without qualification or solicitation spitting some fire advice fire like arson like arsonist advice like a good way to burn your life down advice
140,i agree with the guy but does he really think refugees are that bad especially muslim refugees,woman hate toxic bate male is toxic man,a doctor talking about being a man,aren t these fish edible,men masculinity and love is a fantastic book
141,this mans got them all in the palm of his hand,she doesn t need your love she needs your energy,thats an original idea of jung cool,don t know too many people that would want to go kayaking or canoeing on the sanitary canal it s anything but sanitary,get yo g work on your
142,1 12 to paraphrase rollo t this is the beta mating strategy they think they can get laid by virtue signaling this is analogous to those cucks who believe by being friends with women you will slowly build toward being their boyfriend it never works but is hilarious to watch,i know a girl who actually admitted this fact to me so i don t even want to hear a bitch deny it,i knew that russell brand was or is an actor but didn t watch his movies what i love about him is his great mind great thoughts and just personality thank you russell for that channel,this should be a reminder of the law of unintended consequences that should be considered before we start scrubbing co2 out of the atmosphere,good video big mgtow guy here to wish you all a wonderful day 10 39 thanks for the warning yes everything bad is mens fault and the patriarchy if a woman supports that culture they are victims if men do they are oppressors and fully to blame women can never be blamed for anything because it is always a man s fault
143,has sneako always been as goofy as this d i remember this guy from like 3 years ago but what is this shit now,she is addicted to the chaos drama birds of a feather flock together,why platform this guy russell,intervention the key word we will see the same effect with the immun systems from the vaxxed,any woman you re dating needs to submit assignments or she s not for you
144,he s right about them not streaming live they rely on the sound effects and memes to make it entertaining,bro for the longest time watching this man i thought 304 meant 304 error found still makes sense,my masculinity has me outside splitting firewood right alone with my husband because he should not have to do it by himself at the same time when our boys were little he was far better than me at getting them down for a nap the key word is balance women who are excessively girly are toxic too and they make me sick just like a toxic male would,what about a bird picking up the fish and dropping it on the other side i am not an engineer but i just figured that one out haha,gotta say i respect a man who can pull off a mustache most guys these days can only do it as a temporary goof novelty thing but you really do it a service
145,w sneako w hamza w tate,anthem stupid again tory lanez women don t want a good listener they want the baddest demon in town,he says 80 of youtube users are men but i find numbers like 45 online,also are you using the mac or pc version,i know it s one small part of the video but i want to chime in on the who pays for a date question my view is automatically split it and if not whoever does the asking pays if i ask you to dinner i m paying if you ask me to dinner i will be prepared and expect to pay for my own dinner but am anticipating that you re planning to pay for dinner not that i expect nor require you to pay i just think it s on the person who does the asking if it s not split
146,u do need therapy,you gotta do a video on dr dre s wife filing for divorce,one of my favorite actors in the same room with one of my favorite political artists psychology professors amazing i love it keep on keeping on you two,this is ridiculous not the solution but that humans put themselves into this position,wow matthew hussey really shit the bed on this one comparing paying for dinner to having sex on demand every time also sex workers charge more than an average dinner would cost
147,while soy is a good source of protein it is not good for men it contains heavy amounts of something called phytoestrogens basically a really strong plant source of estrogen when you look at menopause supplements they always contain soy as well as other things that are high in phytoestrogens when you look at skin care for post meno females massive amounts of soy isoflavones genistein phytoestrogens there are many other things like amino acid supplements pea protein and collagen protein that will help you shred and loose weight especially if you re vegan men don t need soy it also makes people swell water weight to some degree,actions speak louder than words fs,i love both of these guys they re both so open to constructive discourse love to see it,it bought time thats it lake ontario is polluted with carp now,the main problem with the red pill is there is no grey area with them they think purely in black and white everything is a middle ground thing
148,soy isn t a great protein source since it s not as bioavailable as cheese or milk protein which means it gets absorbed less by the body you can look that up,appreciate the game g just got out a five year fairly recently and the alpha is back it took some time but i swear i turned from purple pill to red pill the second she ended it now i got a couple baddies in rotation and need some advice more like a couple questions 1 should i be open about talking to other women one wants to be single which is coo wit me we all in the game and the other just broke up with bf but i m assuming just saying i m single is enough do you think there s a smooth way to tell em you re talking to someone else 2 how often should i text them communicate with them they re both different cases haha the single one is way older and the other is a cool friend,as a women who engages in the youtube platform daily i talk to more men who know of jordan peterson that s not to say the women i show peterson to don t enjoy his lectures they all love him they just haven t been exposed to him,i wonder if they put a 1 4 of a mile of some sort of gas like carbon monoxide or whatever is harmful to the fish in the mouth of the canal on grids would do any good,the thing about men not being able to express their feelings is so engrained that many people choose to believe it out of comfortability of that women as it might be easier to ignore things men because they re used to that it s like a comfort zone thing my dad is smart and my older sister too though they still snark at the idea of nature vs nurture and believe that men and women are born so different that men naturally are supposed to be strong providers and have to hide their feelings blah blah they even say that men feel less that women in general and if i say something about that they just say that it s feminist s propaganda and that it s ruining masculinity of today i just can t
149,bro in the us they drink soy milk and think it s ok while in romania i drink wine and beer at 15,nbs bro all these girls be talkin bout good guy but be gettin bussed down by a dumper,seriously two of my favourite minds here when i first started watching russell brand and then jordan peterson on youtube individually i remember thinking how much i d love to see them together low and behold i found this video yay i could sit and listen to them all day russell brand and jordan peterson thank you for speaking up and sharing your thoughts with the world your intelligence and common sense is so refreshing right now,while carp is not considered a normally eaten fish there are some parts of the world especially asia that actually like them a huge source of income is being wasted by not pursuing this idea by placing nets across the canal before the fish get close to the electrified ares would allow for quick and easy capture much like normal commercial fishing is done placed in normal containers for shipping fish and the population could at least be brought down a lot,21 10 or maybe it could be every other or just pay for what you bought if you feel weird having them pay just offer to split or cover next time it s literally that easy me and the person i ve been seeing are both nonbinary and we ve been either splitting paying the next time or if i drove for example they paid and vice versa super easy
150,idk if thats something to be proud of,bro i met a girl exactly like this sigh sometimes better to be single than married it seems,two absolute powerhouse intellectuals in the same room i love it,it s utterly stupid,dude you played saturn bomberman
151,it s basically the only way to survive as men in today s society especially since men are becoming hated more often and are the target of attacks it s basically a defense mechanism to protect themselves and there reputation because if you ve encountered a radical feminist or a person with extreme radical ideas it gets deep and heated fast i had an experience where a girl i had class with said she hates men but in simplified terms all men it was akward ash,steph is only speaking the truth,masculinity does not negate femininity it is catalysed by femininity the submissiveness of feminity is active and primary with regard to agency however femininity uncoupled from maternalism becomes an exercise in pointlessness exploited by the social engineers to destroy masculinity the strategy of saturating the public arena with sensationalised female sexuality while simultaneously pathologizing the natural masculine response to it is derived from pavlovs experiments in which he manufactured neurosis in dogs by simultaneously issuing excitory and inhibitory commands throwing a stick and at the same time saying stay the possible relevance of these experiments to sudden religious and political conversion should be obvious even to the most sceptical pavlov has shown by repeated and repeatable experiment just how a dog like a man can be conditioned to hate what it previously loved and love what it previously hated similarly one set of behaviour patterns in man can be temporarily replaced by another that altogether contradicts it not by persuasive indoctrination alone but also by imposing intolerable strains on a normally functioning brain william sargant battle for the mind,this is interesting so without human would this have been a problem at all or would it have devastated the local wildlife horribly,who pays for the date whoever s idea it was to go on the date
152,i won t lie shneako not sneako owes andrew tate a lot he s moving up to a milly subs quick as fck and i think it s because of the tate movement sneako is good at what he does but tate definitely boosted him,steph always come with straight facts,wow amazing epic,can i charge my tesla in this water,i ve been with my wife for 11 years but i d rather be an incel than a cuck like most heterosexual in gen z the rarity the hetero is in gen z that is
153,what is a soy boy mean,knowledge is power fellas lets sit down and inform ourselves with the mind of steph,0 55 i agree with jordan i have a female friend who watches youtube stumbled across jp and follows him because she liked the ideas,nothing would be more valuable than keeping the carp out not shipping not the barges being able to run nothing should outweigh the decision to shut off that canal,she can t have male friends i suspect all males of doing what i would do hanging around non romantically interested women pretending to be their friends in the hopes that i can smash someday when she s super vulnerable who should pay for the date everybody pays for their own food therefore none of this a date is actually delayed prostitution sh t can be pulled and she s obviously a gold digger because she insisted on the fancy restaurant thing wouldn t happen
154,destiny is a soyboy and you re friends with him,this video hitting,my two favorite experts on a multitude of topics yay and thanks,can t there be a few electric meshes at certain distances across the width only at times of boats passing they can be down and pulses used then,god i m happy i m not a straight girl when i hear those red pilled alpha chads talk
155,bruh i used to know that guy noah he was a videographer for rappers back in the day,the provider game is completely backward if you re alpha they chase and spend money on the men they deeply lust after,i haven t seen russell this nervously excited before he almost seems less confident than normal he is absolutely working for jp s approval and it s kind of cute in bittersweet way probably an aspect of his lack of masculine role models and peers and spaces growing up like he said on the jre that and his obvious respect for peterson so happy these conversations are starting to give masculinity healthy expression in popular culture,this is dumb as hell and should be deemed illegal absolutely disgusting,i saw you first on tara mooknee s channel and am now a fan and subscriber you are hilarious and very intelligent thanks for the premium content
156,whil wheaton is real thought he was just a character,a women actually likes when you care less about her than she cares about you this comes down to putting your value at the highest level let them put you on a pedestal,it never gets old seeing the spark in someones eyes when jp is talking that s when the conversation changes and really begins,spoken like someone who doesn t understand the concept of an invasive species and how they decimate local wildlife,i would only think the man should pay if they are the one asking the person out if you re wording it like hey i d love to take you to dinner sometime and then want to split the bill i could see how that might be taken the wrong way hey want to go out to dinner together just doesn t sound as nice to me maybe because i want to be the one who pays though as i like doing nice things for others that said i m married now and we generally still do whoever suggests it pays if i mention i want chinese food i pay she mentions she wants sushi she pays works for us we like being able to do nice things for each other there is no gender role bs behind it
157,sneako vs me in a fight would be pretty good we re both slim i m sure there s a lot of people who want to see either of us knocked out lol,guys i got a question so like can we hollar at females or no we have to let them come to us,this is how debates should be,army always kill so i suppose it s to kill the fish,you rule bro this video sincerely reflects many of my pov regarding the trend that is happening in social medias
158,what season we in,we all are electric magnetic beings male s are like electric n females are like magnet we push they pull,two brilliant minds i could listen to this for hours,that s a ton of crap oh sorry carp i mean,someone needs to send these incels some sex dolls because no woman should have to deal with this shit
159,bro sounds like daily dose of internet,i guess she s attracted to toxic men s because they probably don t know how to secure their energy n they give it out freely other than men s who on semen retention correct me fam peace bro great knowledge n info,the feminine is not being properly honered socially he understood the assignment,not sure why electricity under water what is wrong with multiple layers of nets under water this seems to me much easier and cheaper than electricity,0 04 actually i m using operagx how dare you j
160,hello everyone,i be one of these toxic men lol and they always come back even years later lol i m in bed with a chick from 5 years ago rn and i ain t hit her up lol,brilliant to get you two together,should just release piranhas to kill the carp trust me im a human,i laugh at misogynistic cishet men using the red pill blue pill matrix reference bc they dont know the matrix was about being trans im pt sure the creator confirmed it too
161,shneako is a friend i didn t have when i was 22,much respect bro actions speak louder than words,we can be masculine without being toxic,my question is will birds not eventually carry them their young or eggs upstream eventually anyways,you had mathew hussey in your intro how is he red pill i could see how that one video seems a little harsh but he gives dating advice to women i d be curious to see you deep dive into him i found him helpful in giving me confidence a few years back
162,also sneako you re all a bunch of sad incels w too much redpill,work on yourself my niggas oh and my fellas,but the femininity in men is somehow offputing or irrelevant to jordan interesting he only thinks women need to be more masculine,what do they do with all the dead fish,this video was good and i liked it
163,0 32 spitting bars,growing up with a single mother is hard now i got ams and steph i see the world differently it s like being 50 years old and just learning how to read a book,if jp were alt right he wouldn t even be having this conversation his stances on women are actually very modernistic and liberal ie this case with motherhood having a good moral code in guiding your children letting them make mistakes and letting them learn being a powerful mother father confident and a good role model for your offspring good stuff,i mean only a lightly motivated individual could just pick up fish from one side and just drop it on the other side some ecological terrorist could devastate the great lakes,oh shit im dying you are funny as hell thank god u exist
164,ok i m definitely staying away from soy i ve been doing good so far but i gotta be extra careful now,fax women loves toxic just as much as they love drama,the essence of the problem as i see it is that the masculine aggression drive risk taking and creativity is being supressed as dangerous and offensive so men are forced to not behave like they actually need to behave to be able to execute their lifes like they need to do to be able to drive society forward this has again led to a stagnation and the women that has triggered this is not happy either it s a western first world problem,do you think they could add a couple bubble fences as well,you are my true hero noah samsen i was going to write this huge long comment about how much i am thankful for your videos about exposing these issues but then i got embarrassed and deleted it all because nothing i say sounds good right now but thank you so much
165,lmaoooo yo is this you re job chick has got to be one of the most reprehensible people ever,took me a while to learn this shit cause i grew up with a lot of sisters and female friends so you know how that goes now i m starting to realize late but better late than never,sex dont sell lol,i really want to drop some carp in the great lakes now,once again you roast these people don t say they are fundamentally wrong because they are factually correct but just make fun of the communities they have formed to help each other what is your solution to men getting no female attention should they just continue to be themselves
166,boys if i m allergic to both nuts and soy does that mean that i cannot be gay because i can t eat nuts and i can t be feminine because i can t have a high dosage of soy my body rejects those two would this suggest that by default i should have a high testosterone level call this a test question,same but once you go it your life changes 360,two amazing minds so quick and agile i could listen to these guys all night,oddly canada does it to prevent their citizens from leaving,are we watching the same video bro
167,idfk or care tbh lol,same man i just read the rational male opened my mf eyes man lowkey got me down about finding out the things enforced by sisters women in my life were bs,two humans conversing and working with their brains how about that,on my way to buy 5 carps and throw them in the lake,no you should better yourself in productive ways that dont involve hating women like idk hitting the gym taking a shower starting a skin care routine getting your life put together
168,idk do gay men have more estrogen than testosterone first we would have to prove that estrogen or testosterone makes you gay or straight which im not sure if thats the reason or not because some straight men are less masculine and more feminine and some straight women are more masculine than feminine so i would say that no your estrogen or testosterone levels do not make you gay or straight it may be a contributing factor to being gay though if other behaviors are observed,if you are young and alpha you have the first part of life figured out you are probably wondering if the wifey material women with the gawk gawk combo attachment exist the answer is yes but its very rare that one awkward shy girl in the corner of your classroom or the fat girl who applied herself years later is that women in the long run the beta male either ends up with no one or the highschool baddie if he has money don t worry these thots will have been run through 100x over gain weight and end up draining their beta male providers of their non sexual energy money and cheat on them,see this is a conversation of learning not just try cancelling ppl because you don t understand,small fish illegally immigrate past the barrier by hiding between barges,the way i always deal with the who should pay for a date is with these steps 1 only go out if i have enough money to spend 2 order food that i have enough to pay for myself 3 offer to pay for the food when we are done 4 fight with the guy about who is going to pay 5 be the fastest one to hand the money to the server
169,as a mostly white person i m sorry for my fucking race,one sure why to get them is to act like don t even exist especially if you got looks girls can t stand being ignored it drives them crazy,someone explain this conversation to me like im two years old thanks a bunch,abit over the top and sad to just stop a few fish while endangering human life,its really weird how these guys who always want full control over their partners are straight up openly looking for abused people to be with just so they can abuse them more because they know they ll be easy to use
170,watching paul joseph watson in 2022,bro i experienced it 1st hand they can not be honest neeeeverrrr,i love russell brands serious conversations i like that he is able to sit with someone who has different views disagree at times gracefully and at the same time having respect for that person i like learning from him,relaxing swim it seems,off topic but you look like an older kit connor that has a moustache and long hair
171,this kid is doing the exact same thing that he s criticizing the others of doing also kid looks like one thems other kids that become rich and end up destroying their lives with drugs and alcohol,theres this girl i follow her feed is nothing but those relationship goaly word porn memes,peterson i would have to think about that a long time before answering it its an idea worth thinking about for a while peterson that intellectual beast is humble enough to admit that he has no opinion on the subject and is not willing to answer impulsively at the other hand russell has such a beautiful mind that could bring a man like peterson to this point beautiful high quality stuff glad that i have found those two,i hope no one takes a bunch of carp from the river and drop it in the lake deliberately,talking about healthy relationship dynamics when you constantly say women do no wrong please tell me you had a single mom at least then it would make sense christ you are pathetically dense
172,what type of man sits around like ooh i wish men around here were manlier like wtf,is it ok to get my girls password to her social media,well also we as consumers don t see the public scrutiny that he gets daily over every little thing said even out of context i think if i were in jordan s position i d be stuck to even get a sentence out without wanting to correct myself and put asterisks everywhere lol,what happens when there is power outage,when does he say that
173,society would be better if men became a little more masculine,if she ok with it but honestly i would t do that unless u feel something is off,i know right so cool to see him once again affirm his desire to always be precise in his speech and commentary i think that s much harder to do than making a snap comment for the sake of doing so too many people think they need to answer right away,thought maybe the electiric fence will create a bottle neck collect so many fish and then all of a sudden you guys have a bird problem and that sucks worse,look at this fancy boy arc trex windbreaker they will survive a nuclear apocalypse so i ll file it as practical
174,smoke herb occasionally take edibles instead,question when u say you shouldn t believe what these women say does that go for the freaky talk that they give you via text or on the phone too a chick views me alpha and is sexually attracted to me from what i can tell we plannin to link in july,yes masculinity needs to be developed in women just as much as femininity needs to be developed in men each without abandoning their own foundational natural way of being,why do they jump,as to who pays for lunch it s whoever invited the other person or split the bill or whoever didn t pay last time or in my case whoever got paid most recently
175,5 30 oof,blue pill bob uhm stephon what s a 304 stephiscold put it on your calculator and turn it upside down,the parts where they discussed the devouring mother and toxic parenting hits home so hard i think there are way too many people in their teens and early twenties that feel like they have to seek validation from their parents just to feel good about themselves when the parents in the family are put up on a pedestal it can create a huge amount of stress and tension in families i think it s very important to have healthy honest boundaries in families,it is not a vital waterway those barges move very few goods compared with big rivers gov t is stupid close it down get commerial fisherman in there to catch them and make fertilizer out of them and i understand they are edible and not that bad we learned this 200 years ago when we brought the common carp here now they re all over thanks a lot arkansas,hope she see this bruh
176,fuck bro i think i have gyno but i m working it out only 12 so probably,you speaking hella facts you be killing me,i can wake and sleep to the conversation of these two open parachutes,i disagree with the concept of invasive with regards to wildlife let nature be nature it wouldn t be what it is today if every invasive species was contained for millions of years you aren t meant to freeze a global ecosystem in place that is not organic now invasive humans on the other hand,i think it s not that hard to think if i ask someone on a date then it s assumed i pay or i should clarify before said date that it ll be split my partner pays some dates and i pay some other dates and sometimes we ll split also yeah using someone s body is different than two people going on a date double standard double standard would be the woman asking a guy on a date and expecting him to pay in full
177,keep opening the peoples eyes,at work watching this like a fiend,jordan is a genius,haven t you done a video on this before,holy shit how have i never looked up your channel before from noel s stuff right up my alley and i swear you are just as funny if not funnier than noel don t tell him i said so he is scary
178,i can t lie i love whole milk but soy milk kinda good but whole milk will always be on top,just be you you dont have to play games and if shes real like 100 she s not going to play the games its simple its either a person likes you for you or they don t and another thing stop chasing and replacing and be wise because if you knew that the future wasn t promised you ll think different men don t have a biological clock but you need to be careful waiting time because it s something you can t get back,i try to be patient and understanding with jp russ i really do but i just can t stand him you do well to keep your calm and maybe a few more yoga sessions and i ll be there but i can t stand his half truths and outright misleading bullshit i switched off the moment he said the fact he attracted so many white young males was a fluke or because most people who watch youtube are male wtf i mean own your bullshit please jp all he s about is right wing propaganda and just scrolling through his fb page will prove as much he appeals to disenfranchised white males who can t stand post modernism and all its complexity because almost everything he s said bolsters their positions and views he s a right wing shill,just let in eu fishermen and there won t be any fish to electrify in like 2 3 years,more simping with no explanations or data
179,room shambels opinion,steph is cold period nothing but facts,i love how jordan randomly relates stuff to harry potter whenever he gets the chance,as an ichthyologist i study fish i don t particularly like the electric gates carp get huge and are very resistant the carp will most likely get by and other fish that migrate between the rivers and the lakes get immediately killed ontop of this all this carp exist on the other side give it 30 years and they will decimate the lower great lakes i don t know what to do about carp it s quite terrifying as they can survive in as little as 3 feet of water because they use a method of feeding by lifting up the ground and filtering for food absolutely ruining all plants and destroying ecosystems carp are some of my favorite fish regardless,redpill stuff is so quietly pervasive in the dating world and it s really easy as a single and dating woman to get sucked in and spiral whenever i m reminded how many men out there feel this way the bit about men will only marry who they want to and women will only marry who they can def is hitting me in the i can t find a decent guy to commit to me which means i must be unlovable and will never be worth committing to core belief it takes effort to return to a baseline of remembering that there are guys out there who aren t shitbags it s just that this sort of stuff gets platformed by young and clueless men who honestly aren t likely even being faced with the choice of having multiple women to decide on marrying anyway edit having watched on some you re right about the who does this help what purpose does it serve question i think it s the emotional version of just work hard nerd boy and one day you ll be the boss of those guys that bullied you in high school yeah she won t have sex with you now but you ll get to turn her down for marriage once she s old and dried up
180,ok but the breast milk comes from a woman that has extrogen no testosterone and the little boy that drinks that is similar to drink soymilk is a stupid question myb but i want answers ahaha,remember fellas never listen to the fish listen to the fisherman,when was this recorded,are they resistant to electricity the video seems to imply that the larger something is the more likely it is to be effective probably because the voltage is applied to an area their concern is that very small fish can make it through but not larger fish,on my first date with a cute lightskin girl i was paying for almost everything until one point she said who ever pulls their wallet out first is paying she ended up paying for the rest of the night
181,let s bring masculinity back,you like hajime no ippo too,56 of youtube s total users are male while 44 are female hootsuite wearesocial 2021,thanks tom for coming over to my home city,what s the first guys accent
182,being high energy and talking quickly isnt a quality sneako,we re the fisherman finding the right fish in the sea unfortunately there s no right fish it s just you get a fish eat it get another one unless the loyal rare fishes,this is food for me i m odd yes but i don t care lol,they couldn t get you a reflective vest that fit,this video feels over stimulating
183,these lames don t deserve in any detention,she post that she want a different type of dude to try to get the dude thats really digging her out in his feelings meanwhile homie still digging her out,parental figures,ignorant people always do ignorant things they should have known what would happen with the carp if they had any intelligence,i think an issue is assuming that the red pill community is speaking about all women some are but some aren t and some make good points delivery is not great though
184,they re not anymore dont push that narrative,i literally will waste a chick time because i know they lie and are low key toxic and that s in the beginning,jordan peterson is a genius,amd them some dude puts a couple in some buckets drives to the new lake and just sets them free,wtf is that first guy s accent is this a bit
185,anyone else get a drag queen piece of trash ad before the bud started,honestly big bro i thought you were older closer to 30s range probably the beard and the way you conduct yourself but i just turned 20 maybe its my ethnicity but now that i think of it not cause i feel beta or some ive been peeping vids for a while you re right in most cases to me my self i feel baby faced im not sure if you covered that but aside from working out and conducting yourself alpha is there any way to counter that or is that just some id need to work around i already got a clean whip and i got a lil cheese but i dont be flashy with it cause loudest niqqa in the room not the toughest id say i look halfway decent fucked enough to kno i wanna play them hoes that aint give me the time a day,shouldn t the title say masculinie,introducing few tons of big mouth bass they will destroy carp frys in no time,lmfaooooo why do i laugh so hard at your content you hit that need for an intellectual commentator that doesn t take his work too seriously bc your job is expressing your opinions on youtube love it subscribed
186,snicker boy you are feminine,i have a question please women always say to other women don t act too available act like you re always out and busy but i m a super homebody wayyy before the quarantine i m work than home and i m always home on the weekends is that a bad look should i act like i go out to a man thank you,the fact that russell can have a conversation with peterson wow,this video alone has me tempted to relocate about a dozen carp into the great lakes,can i have the name of the fruit animal video plz it s for a friend
187,ok jonathan,i know a girl that s a homebody and 50 niggas know where she live,imagine if we had politicians like these guys,answer money,umm the bible says for women to submit buddy not every man or women is worldly in any situation you need a leader and a second in command your definition 9f submission is subjection not submission
188,i know many trades men who would think you are as soy as you are calling these guys lol,sarabi motley i really am i homebody a lot of women are homebodys i hate clubs always have but thanks for the reply,masculinity is normal just like how feminity is,do these fish die after being shocked why not just open fishing season,not everyone is christian
189,idk what s the plan behind these leftists supporting islam im muslim and honestly i think they re full of shite i know they d ban hijab as soon as they can and say it s pro choice or something plus we re against homosexuality in islam like strongly against it so idk why are they trying to win us they think we re stupid,no just tell him you re a homebody i m pretty sure he ll actually value you more are you really a homebody nobody knows on this channel he really exposes female nature and characteristics so you might wanna go on asha c page,strong men make good times good times make soft men soft men make hard times hard times make strong men strong men make good times,what is the price tag of this bs,you know how you find guys well when you do that can you also point in the right direction for the guys who follow those guys try making a video like that i know you brought up that one subreddit before make something with that
190,disliked for associating eating soy with being a liberal you can be a conservative and vegan you re better than this sneako also soy does not decrease testosterone phytoestrogen is not the same thing as estrogen literally the beer that pjw likes to drink has more phytoestrogens look at this skinny neck guy acting like he s a manly he doesn t exactly have a deep voice or a lot of muscle mass testosterone levels are definitely dropping and that s because people s lifestyles are fucked they only eat processed junk and sit inside all day never exercising it s not because people eat soy what is it with conservative people and being anti vegan,love you g,two master debaters at work,the carp have completely destroyed the ohio tennessee cumberland mississippi and missouri river water sheds it s a complete tragedy what has happened to the midwest just so some fish farms could keep the stock ponds clean american business model at its finest,the animal and fruit jokes at the begging caught me off gaurd
191,leftists will do anything but take accountability,your poster is cold,two of my favorite men discussing love it,as an european i wish we had this much fish in our rivers and lakes also here this kind of carp is quite popular on fish farms so people would be happy if price went down by at lease half or if fishermen had something to fish to begin with,i ditched one of my best friends who happened to be a man because my boyfriend at the time could not handle it accused me of cheating with him constantly i regret it to this day i m sorry scott
192,i made it into the video at 11 50 epicccc,i m playing obv when i say this where the girls that wamted to compare hand sizes luv the vid steph,really enjoy these actual conversations noone is yelling or chest thumping just calm rational discussion it s really a breath of fresh air,what is the saying nature finds a way great lakes are doomed,i always feel the need to bring this up when discussing redpill bro content but casual reminder that the red pill in the matrix was red because that s what estrogen pills looked like at the time and the directors are trans women who said the matrix movie was a transgender metaphor
193,bro fem men have been around since cave men there are a lot more actors these days for sure but fem men is also biological,this guy cracking more codes than jumanji,i m high and watching russell brand interviewing jordan peterson and all i m hearing is ali g i don t know why d,i grew up and live in south florida where the invasive pythons are destroying the everglades by literally eating all of the native birds and animals etc sadly there strong speculation that someone released their pet python into the ecosystem at on point unleashing this disaster i have vacationed on the great lakes michigan and superior with my family and both lakes are magnificent my real fear is some deranged individual in some form of ecoterrorism is going to intentionally release carp into the great lakes which will make this system null and void i pray it never happens but into todays world sadly nothing surprises me anymore,17 40 my guy is playing a worship song behind his redpill alpha bro advice so that s something it s oceans by hillsong the megachurch i grew up in was obsessed with it
194,sneako come to belgrade,trust the actions not there words fellas,sir you ve earned my subscription excellent content,bioengineer the carp,by these guys own logic would it not be more manly to be able to face heartbreak and other various emotions and process them rather than to hide their feelings like are these dudes really admitting to be cucked by their own emotions i dunno seems pretty weak to me
195,i support refugees but not everyone is welcomed,bro you were really in your bag on this one another one of your coldest videos gospel,well now i have to let my kids put their own shoes on i am never going to be on time for anything ever again i hate it when really smart people make good points,wait so i can take 100 carp fish and put them in the lake and kill a huge industry,the tom and jerry thing is aave btw
196,men and women can be gentle and also can be tough just be yourself some dudes are very competitive and some are just loud as fuck samd goes for women you don t have to be loud and talk down to a stranger to establish your manhood and to the women respecting men doesn t make you lesser person do men think we are lesser being because we hold doors for you and tries to protect you it s out of respect it is mens natural duty to be protective towards to women just be youself and remember that life is about learning control your emotions so you can make logical decisions otherwise they will use your emotions against you to control outcome of all you do guard your heart be confident but don t show it out loud all the time real g move in silence tigers and lions don t bark think about that,man i m so blessed that your content popped up on my recommended feed i needed to hear shit like this,you know your in good hands when people as professional as jordon speaks to russel about disney characters,no gyarados,i ll never stop finding it funny that incels chose the term red pill to describe their aspirations to toxic masculinity in reference to what they didn t know was a thinly veiled metaphor for estrogen pills in a story that is itself a metaphor for being trans
197,paul joseph watson is so on the money,females say they want many things but when it comes to nice guys the majority of females aren t really attracted to them even tho they say that s what they want my ex went back with her ex because i was emotional clingy but that s basically the nice guys way of treating a female and reacting to her bad input all this girl ever wanted in reality was some toxic guy because her ex was like that and she also only wanted sex and attention from guys she never wanted me for being nice she only saw me as a ego booster and validator and sex toy she liked the way i treated her like that so when she went back with her ex she wanted to be friends cuz she still expected the same tampon use of me towards her she knew she had me emotionally trapped so her only way of making herself feel better of leaving me for another dude was keeping me close cus then that makes her think she did nothing wrong and she only felt bad about what she did but never regretted it she posts videos on her story of nice relationships and cute shit like that but what she wants is completely different she gives herself lies to believe in also so other dudes think that s what she wants and she gets to get hit up by other guys in her rotation she literally told me guys are only tools for her like sprinkles on a sunday,russell is like a curious child ideas and thoughts popping up with complete innocence and a yearn for change,firstly honored tom came to my homeland secondly i knew nothing about this electrified fish barrier only a quick drive from my home,i always went with whoever asks for the date pays at least in the beginning then go halves or take it in turns
198,soy blocks your testosterone and also blocks your body from obsorbing nutrients from food plastic water bottles are lined with estrogen to,i lowkey hate females from my generation,this reminds me of bruno pitching his business ideas to donald trump,all over the world water problems umericans lets do 10km toxic into the water,some of this music is the celeste soundtrack forsaken city sever the skyline mix at 1 20 and 11 24
199,1000s of years ago these soy boys would not exist modern crops have allowed this inferior genetic material to thrive back in the day they d been eaten by sabertooth tigers while the women would be hiding behind the high testosterone men blue hair feminist would be pleading with with the patriarchy that doesn t exist to please club them over the head and drag them back to cave and cook whatever brontosaurus you bring home to the cave thousands and massage your feet guys you ve been domesticated like house cats what is best in life to crush your enemies see them driven before you and to hear the lamentations of their women,know the ledge,i could listen to these two all day long,human intervention causes more harm we ve electrified this canal,ayo fat joe with the barssss
200,don t drink water from plastic bottles releases bpas which mimic estrogen,steph bro you re goated g,it seems strange and hilarious how these guys can view their own mothers as mere specimens feminity i think they re just hiding from the real issue which is about people just doing the right thing,what are the ecological costs from the power required to electrify this barrier,love these videos laughed all morning teaching emotional intelligence to these boys is god s work thankyou from this woman
201,maybe your misogonistic and need to touch grass,i ve seen it happen to me at work one girl that didn t want me back then saw this other girl that was flirting with me and all of a sudden she wanted to get to know me lol,calling out all natural harmonious thrivers of nature shout outs to us this phrase tough times create strong men good times create weak men has a lot of misconstrued misused over analytical externally attached rubbish in some areas stemming from a monetary system vs living in the natural real world these tough modern men would not survive in the wild without some gun because they think that thriving is about surviving almost as if they have forgotten or are unaware of gardening and self sustainability that s not really tough stuff and it takes more than sheer force to go from surviving to thriving i swear people just pick something that sounds catchy but don t really reflect deep enough on these things aristotle once said whosoever is delighted in solitude is either a wild beast or a god many of us do delight in solitude in any kinds of changing times guess that makes us beast gods goddesses so i guess this also means that peoples linear concepts of hard times and good times is a limiting belief aka a brule score 9000 to the people surpassing these human made brules meant to divide humanity our love is stronger than the perceived divisive biases created by what is clearly emotionally hurt men who dont seem to realize that their problems isn t another human but a currently evolving economic system that geniusly has enslaved the people thankfully even that is changing and the people and even animals are uniting against these unholy men and women or beings hell bent on delusions of control power imagined self importance greed temporary constructs that are inevitably impermanent namaste,forget the fish they need electrified water at the mexico border zzzzzzzzzzzzz,manosphere heads complain about women not wanting to let a man provide then make us pay for our own meal anyways lol
202,bro i drink soya milk because i was used to it i m bout a stop,women love that because your attention has diverted to the girl who was flirting with you,though russell brand is a deep thinker i think he s an idiot,surely it would have been easier cheaper and more effective to just block that canal physically and cut it off from the lakes talk about over engineering a solution,ok but why is his nose soooo flared and whyyyyy is he talking like that shotgun barrels with a weird ass forced accent
203,accepting muslim refugees is normal afyer all the us was the problem as to why their homes are destroyed dont let me start hating on u sneeko,a girl argues with me all the time even when i know i m in the wrong yet she always comes back to me and says sorry daddy lol,holy trinity is man woman and child not man god and holy spirit church worked very hard to eliminate the truth of religion so they could be extra greedy,anyone else thought it was to keep mexicans out lmaoo,reading the comments i m really glad i m not the only one who believes that whoever pays should be whoever invited the other to go on a date
204,nah hating on immigrants is apparently the new woke now,that s cause she s cheating on you lol,i get everything always have done they get everything and have a lovely peaceful chat about things i hope people enjoy it life is beautiful when you understand it,what s to stop them from walking or getting a ride up idiots they are already in there someone has already dumped them off in there,thinking about the gender roles of who should pay is so interesting because even when i m the one paying i hand the card or cash to my boyfriend and he does the actual transaction for me and i ve never given that a second thought i was just like yeah ur the guy so u pay the person but i ve never thought of it as it always has to be his money that s so interesting to me
205,the main thing just avoiding carbs its just pure sugar and stresses our bodies out in several ways we have evolved to to eat fruit veg meat and thats what we should eat not carbs and soybeans are fine lol the studies are flawed because guys who easily follow others who tell them to eat soy have low t in the first place hence why they follow bs like soy diet,basically they want to try and change them knowing it wont happen but stay anyway while ignoring someone on there shit handling business,how about we start framing the positive aspects of masculinity instead of having a hard focus on the toxic elements,that s great now go eradicate the karp already,dude the youtube algorithm s reaction to watching some of these far right con artists is frightening you are bombarded with all manner of all right grifting from politics to incels red pill to strange alternative history essays that excuse the actions of various autocrats etc alt right pipeline is real and robust in 2022
206,carbs are the main source of energy for us carbs are really important,uhh def not simpatico lol,it s almost weird to see two people who actually listen have a discussion today listening is a skill most people only hear and believe they are listening while they wait impatiently for their opportunity to shoehorn in a trite talking point they picked up in whatever echo chamber they usually haunt it s refreshing in one sense to watch this video but ultimately somewhat worrisome in that there does not appear to be a path before us to a time again where this would be the norm,we are going through the beginning of the energy crisis and the us are electrifying large bodies of water just have a fishing completions or some bollovks,misogyny is cringe yo noah samsen 2022

211,you don t know what feminism means,what y all fellas think about when females say they like boys who don t post on social media or don t have that much followers,two brilliant good honest respectful and eloquent intellectuals,i recently got a direct hit to the shin by a silver carp this past weekend it hurts a lot,there may not be many good places online to discuss and understand masculinity in a healthy way so maybe everyone should watch our flag means death maybe just a little bit so they can think and calm down some please im begging
212,soyboy is a funny word to use but consuming soy does not affect testosterone,miamislugger i only use social media to post my music,i love these conversations woman btw that subscribes to peterson,and all this work and money could be undone by one person dropping a carp in to the great lake,love the video man
213,yeah call them fluoride boys,probably true a lot of young guys entertain ig and fb like a girl would do stories posts while a guy not using is probably not giving a flying fuck and focused on his purpose debate opened fellas let s hear it,its about individuality if you re a man you must be like this,the carp look like good eating,sometimes you comment because you enjoyed a guitar hero reference because you found it humorous and want to engage with the creator
214,that soy shit is cap,check her phone you will see everything you need to know,if women need empowerment then why men are having a mental crisis,freddy oh god hey these things don t leak do they frank leak hell no these things were made by the u s army corps of engineers,i feel ways about this im just gonna say thank you for existing noah thank you v many

216,9 20 if the migrant was actually muslim he wouldn t have been gay,factual claims,i pray that god blesses you gentlemen thank you for having this amazing interview and for blessing us with it,great video very informative i hope the carp never reach the great lakes that would be a disaster for the native fish,make your woman submit huh well guess what redpillers im dating a femboy parry this you fucking casual

219,hes not white bros,rorisang pitswane it has to,i just can t sit here and listen to that accent for 8 minutes i m sorry,so if a bird accidentally drops a carp upstream before killing it this would all be for nothing,to be honest i used to act quite similarly to these lads till one day i just decided to fix up i guess i started training and got myself a good job that i enjoy got a lot more confidence in myself then soon after i suddenly had women being interested in me funny that
220,bro i m tellin yalls kids be cutting off them legs to get the handicapped parking spot and teachin them kids it s ok to do i feel bad for the people who actually need them cuz then stereotypes fuck em over and idk who to hate anymore and then you got the people that can t tell the difference and start supporting bs,they love toxic shit that s why they love watching shows like love n hip hop basketball wives,i think that this one part should have it s on episode 9 00 is not enough time this should be expanded upon and broken down even more this made so much sense and is very true in our current society as a whole love your work i will definitely continue to watch your show thanks for the content,can i drink it,i appreciated the nazi zombies reference noah
221,wait so soy y all mean like the sauce can effect me too god damn what am i gonna have my chicken with ranch,basically the truth is the opposite of what she tells you,stong father figure is something we all need in our life,i think there was a dirty jobs episode on this many years ago,cut the sex off and he ll run out of things to say no more whining
222,no it can t they re lying soy in itself is not bad for you,4 40 4 44 is facts my ex was exactly like that,may have to listen to the rest because this snippet was to vague for me,who will win the barrier vs one memer releasing some carps on the other side this is in no way a permanent solution,weird how mad some fellas in the manosphere are about holdovers from the good old days they re advocating for
223,good point but how tf do you get faster,this some og stephiscold,i liked that he talked about the overprotectived mother or whatever cause my mom is kind of like this ive moved out at 20 and because im the baby of 3 shes been having a really hard time letting me go but shes goteen better at it overtime,i was expecting some large bodies of electrified carp floating amidst the river i left disappointed i m hungry,bruh really now redpill tiktok that s legit complaining the trash stinks in the heat few things good come from tiktok on a good day when you re looking for trash you re gonna get trash hell being explosive meme able trashy is how people get views it s why people wanted the site as a whole taken down besides of the whole data mining tiktok is brainrot since it is made to hit you with a deluge of content and keep hitting you with it
224,paul joseph watson is the man,fellas just focus on yourself is that simple,ive seen his name on youtube for so many months now and idk who he is i know hes in the man o sphere thing,seriously they use thousands of taxpayers dollars for something that can be achieved by encouraging local fishermen to hunt them into extinction if there s anything humans know how to do it s cause the extinction of a species,noah is the compassionate leftist that we all need to be more like
225,because it will be easier for eastern powers to take over,toxic guys are winning and there s no way around it,the harry potter mention and glee they drew from it made my day,i just pictured aquaman down there saying look an enemy vehicle approaches quick throw these fish at them,why do half of these alfalfa boys feel the need to yell at the camera
226,they might be watching this rn hahahah and might be thinking of a good comeback video,yeah maybe you guys should date eachother,there is so much variance in masculine feminine qualities in either men and women that it is fair to say we are equal furthermore these roles may completely change in different cultures suggesting it is socially constructed there is no need conform to some prescribed identity role except to fulfill some societal traditions or customs identity can be as unique as you want though fluid in its adaptation to society,i know this is off topic but i just rickrolled by n ad,every time a red pill alpha male talks about evolutionary psychology or gamifies dating women it gives me this weird feeling inside like men think women have this internal monologue constantly running telling them how to act around men what to do what to say instead of y know having normal thoughts of a normal person like any time a man talks to me my brain is running all these calculations about how much money i think he has and whether he ll be able to produce strong children or whatever the fuck it s just weird
227,15 14 respect,they love that toxic shit tho,jbp talks masculinity with russell brand russell with a man bun someone gonna tell him,i love how at the start a fish just launched into the air,i m new to your channel and was just feeling out the vibes for a few videos but man that tankie joke got me okay i m in

229,5 30 he slipped and said the n word,their body language speaks louder than words that are coming out of their mouth,mary poppins is the goat of positive feminine arch types,he s out of breath,i feel like whoever asked the other out on the date should pay for the first date then go back and forth on the future dates
230,bro he s half filipino and half black,always remember fellas she s not yours it s just your turn,8 10 lysa arryn from game of thrones literally breast feeding her 12 year old boy from her throne,ya wanna see those carp disappear pay people 1 for each carp they catch they ll be extinct in a decade,new podcast cool guys being dudes

232,legit question i dont understand why to drink bottled water vs tap whats the thing with tap water,this hurts bruh i know it s true i m crying dog,as expected hierarchies are invoked rather quickly why does masculinity have to be described in the context of a hierarchy,easy solution release great white sharks into that bish,that whole tom and jerry bit was cool but are we gonna ignore the fact that he said no big bro does he think his girlfriend is gonna cheat on him with her brother
233,can t wait to see you at rumble,he is speak the truth right now,what s the point of platforming this fraud dave rubin levels of grifting on display here,of course they did no limit to human stupidity,that s not the same thing at all the guy who feels like he has to pay is not the same as the woman demanding the man pays it s the same as the analogy about expecting sex it s very lopsided both are influenced by the way society expects things to be but only one of them is benefiting from it i understand that it s because of the patriarcy but it s not the same
234,where tf have i been since when did so many men start consuming soy products and why,clicked faster than a beta at a woman s disposal,young men need role models and unfortunately there aren t as many in local communities and in the media the message of what a man should be and how he should act is completely shattered luckily there are y few channels that share useful messages like jocko podcast mastery order order of man jordan b peterson if you are a young man searching for answers and looking for a role model share and learn these messages and if you were lucky enough to have a great role model in your life share your knowledge so that others can benefit as well become a great man that can be trusted and relied upon cheers reader,anyone else remined of super mario sunshine here,to all the guys hating on red pill ask yourself this question does the creator of this video look like he d ever have a chance of sleeping with a 9 or 10 case closed
235,props to you sneako,facts bro,i think people should realise that you dont have to follow anyone be yourself dont be afraid to do feminin things and try to socialise,just what we need on the rio grande stops invasive species,i m not feeling the will to change here it s putting way to much emphasis on women being at fault for toxic masculinity
236,am i trippin or he said the n word,i ll never stop watching ams and stephiscold endless knowledge sometimes you don t retain all the information the first time so you gotta keep watching,over protection of males happens in asian culture for sure,couldn t they do it during covid 19 lockdown traffic was lower so car and traffic jam wasn t the issue anymore,i petition these guys safe other men since they hate women so much
237,taking your wife s last name is only acceptable if you have a embarrassing or bad last name,i listened to what woman says like for real and saw them as equal person to me jeez then i took the red pill and woke up i look back and can t believe how stupid and blind i was back then,i understand they are both talking about masculinity but i think peterson brought something very important to the table of parents letting children fail in order for them to create a mental pattern for them to solve their mistake or try to find a reasonable enough conclusion on how to avoid that failure in other words learning,love your videos,8 52 is he talking abt lesbians w comphet rn
238,but have you tried vietnamese soy milk,dang bro i remember being nervous and said to myself they re just female turns out the word female was a whole story with female nature and sh woke me up for real i m having some second thoughts like red pill rage or something but i m still learning and improving,petersen thinks assertiveness power equates to masculinity why can t femininity be assertive why does a woman have to borrow from masculinity answer bc jp can t think beyond gender traditions,carp are in lake superior,00 33 i watch all those channels
239,my ma has breast fed me untill i had teeth cus i just bite her so first she gave me formula 1 day passed and she understands that i was growing breasts she threw all that formula shit away and started giving me goat milk from the family goat now im tall blonde and with a deep voice,a fish will never teach you how to catch fish take what women say with a grain of salt they backwards,exactly it reminds me of when peterson was talking about why women wear lipstick the only reason he could come up with was sex based he lacked the intelligence to grasp there s also a wealth status symbol factor a communal factor and most obviously an individuals self expression he s just so cringe worthy,it s to keep me out,hey noah i appreciate the nazi zombies reference but i don t want to get engaged man love you tho
240,just discovered you holy fuck you re based,do the opposite of they say,6 19 cool russel brand,hey bud your in the fuckin usa we don t size up fish in kgs we use lbs,not the strawberry elephant
241,natural selection should get rid of all male feminist blue pilled soyboys,i ve had a female tell me that before bro she was giving me choosing signals so i approached her and said what s up and she said that she was starring at me because she wanted to snatch my soul went to her crib and got my soul snatched 3 days later,men need masculine energy from society but here s my theory feminism is inescapable it s crossed all types of establishment from university and work etc i used to think feminism was important to help allow men to better understand the emotions of their significant other or someone they re dating and to some extend i believe that is necessary so that men can understand if a good woman is not ready for sex on the first date and the man continues to push getting sex out of her till she sub misses the idea let s not kid ourselves it s rape however my stink for feminism indirectly allowed women to believe that being a woman gives them all the privileges and none of the responsibilities of being an adult,organize a competition of best carb rescipe and let people fish them freely at the very lease get them minced up and use it for animal feed human will drive it to extinction,you were not taught correct
242,funny how hasan charles and that bearded police officer sounds just the same,be solitude,men with buns in thier hair have no business discussing masculinity,now this video is up your bound to have at least 1 kid go fishing for 2 carps and then dump them the other side just for the fun of it,why is the camera angle for 75 of these dudes straight up the nose holes
243,the world is doomed if majority of men are like those liberal soy boys,yo steff i really believe this and nobody else says this tying into what you said about women not counting the other 30 guys and only counting 3 or 4 or whatever women like how people push out forget trauma i swear genuinely forget push it out their minds and really truly think like instead of the actual 80 guys they think its like 15 or something some real weird sociopathic kinda stuff these women be doing maybe something to do with how they act all innocent on the outside know that society family other women etc likes to say insinuate women should act appear to act a certain way so they all jefferey dahmer sociopath style push it out their minds like it never happened and they call us pigs f n whack jobs,what are women doing if they re not watching youtube submit your answers below,that s not the army,i d really love to see you cover this topic from the flip side though if you really wanted to make a great video that stands out make one about good guys who do a great job showing how to talk to women talk to different men about how to field and what s appropriate in different environments there s a ton of content to go into lots of guys desperate to hear it and you d be doing a wholesome service that fits with your base
244,i feel like the more and more videos people make on you that s just gonna be an easy sign for youtube to see and just ban you for no reason and i am also confused as to how you have haters as i haven t heard a terrible take from you and was a little crazy to see normal people excited and happy to see you beat up in that video those people always use harm as a solution never understood that,word they lies become thier truths,russell stays using big ass words lmfao,so why is it the army not the marine doing this why do people doing this need to know how to use weapons navigate war,look man if you need fucking tutorials on how to talk to women then you have to be working on a lot more stuff it s simple talk to women like they re humans like you re equals
245,aint no way 9 04,keep it cold they always going to be backwards,it seems like the focus gets lost in the aesthetic more than the motivation behind the action example frontiersman and tribesmen back in the day had to frickin build their own homes survive brutal attacks from hostile neighbors and work eighteen hours a day just because a modern man doesn t bench 300 pounds shoot a gun with deadly accuracy and whatever else doesn t mean he s not doing the same things protecting his family building a home and earning a living,carps are tasty af,this whole channel is it s all mens fault women do wrong only because of patriarchy sheesh
246,sneako ignore my pop but when you do the high voice thing and get really emotional weather its annoyed angry be non bias and professional and everyone can take you more seriously take after tate he can be completely chill yet exciting and get a point across hope you see this and ignore my spelling im eatng rn,in louisiana we call 304s 504s,the trinity in ussr was marx lenin stalin not mao,7 bill fish 16 bill usd boat industry,3 minutes in and 4 ads and an ad read that s fucked
247,it may sound weird but the evolution obviously skipped theese mothrfucke s how do we deal with them they are real threat,in chinatown we call them 604s,not to nitpick but there s no way youtube audience is 80 male i don t know of any female who isn t a senior citizen who doesn t watch youtube,idea how about a lock where after its closed you put toxin in keep it for a while then filter it out again and open it on the other side or is it not possible to filter out toxin,i am a late gen xer on millenial cusp i was always under the impression if a guy asked me to dinner or to see a band or movie especially if i was broke would make a little joke that i thought it was great but couldn t afford it which was the truth because i didn t want them to expect i thought they had to pay some guys would be a little hurt bc they wanted to take me on a great day i m an empath as well guess as a human it sucks to be nice
248,sneakos discord is the biggest joke guy acts like the pillar of red pill freedom of speech yet the staff there and amount of lack of speech is insane,eating my ramen to this,the whore of babylon in revelation the devouring mother,on this scale its defnitly not easy to fully filter out toxin even the smallest rudiments could accumulate and cause ecological damage downstream,thank you for making the world a tiny bit better in your own way
249,you used to be more articulate persuasive and sober before your brain is still high tier your direction right now though is polarising,do yo call them out when they say they ain t have sex in months,if you would ve told me 10 years ago that i would be inspired by the intellectual curiosity of russell brand i would ve told you well ten years is along time to wait for that,what s stopping bird from picking up the carps and dropping them on the other side,man shutcho ass up why is every unfunny commentary youtuber so damn liberal
250,l on taking your wife s name unless you re marrying into money,cold g,for fucks sake stop overthinking life just take care of your family wife husband boyfriend girlfriend siblings parents children and your friends don t be an asshole either and enjoy life easy as that oh and always strive to be better that will certainly help you and especially don t over complicate it if your not a psychologist or something like that trust me its not a good idea,the fools on here are stating the fish cannot get through this chokehold due to electrified water as a train goes right past only 50 ft away did you get a close look at the engineer on the train that passed slow it down and look again not gonna rat em out but that engineer was lookin green in the gills that s all i m sayin stupid they think they stopped the carp,10 56 women will never happily be the bread winners while you sit on your ass all day playing video games so why even bother
251,when are you getting leafy on,itz yo boy steff,i think russell brand is a good guy but hes not all there i think drugs did their damage,honestly with the weaknesses of this barrier i think it s likely that there is a carp population in the lake already it just hasn t gotten to the fast part of exponential growth yet,i like to laugh at simps laughing at incels it s very meta
252,why western men are becoming feminine,intro song,the same can be said for peterson considering he was ruthlessly addicted to pills for years his addiction was so bad he had to be placed in a medically induced coma mr clean up your room and do the responsible thing was a a low down junkie,i give up the usa is just hopeless,no tom or jerry i m heading to the streets now have these guys even talked to a woman in real life the 40 year old virgin club
253,look at his manly mustache and look at sneakos pubes stache he looks more masculine than sneako no cap his behaviour is weird but rage streaming is immature sneako your the most lit streamer for children and incels,like lil durk said don t ever put your all into a bitch cause she gon leave,i love to sit on your show or even do a pod cast to shed a lot of light on rather one to share common knowledge and me my self i have an way way over protective mother my ex who i am not allowed to see i dred the thing s she is putting into his head and raising our child alone,i thought fish eggs could attach to birds,make your own content emasculated loser
254,9 44 this study was performed on rats or mice where they gave them insane high amounts of soy no human ever consumes these amounts of soy and there are no definitive human trails where a lowering of testosterone or sperm count has been observed soy actually shows health benefits when consumed moderately asian cultures have been consuming soy for ages and before the western diet got introduced to them they where healthy af i m talking about natural soy here not gmo soy that is also sold in the us,it seems like most of the stuff you teach about women go hand and hand with building a business to a certain degree,thank u russle thank u not being properly honerd well sed,those fishes could feed millions of people,i know this is besides the point but what makes the most sense to me is whoever asked the other out pays also splitting the check to me personally is strange but i honestly think that i think like this bc i m mexican and food is a major bonding point so people fight over who s gonna pay the check in whole
255,was looking for this comment thanks,what do you use if you are doing a voice over for video,how amazing is jordan peterson when he s not being attacked by rabid people with victim complexes,if all it takes is 2 small fish to get through which apparently can this is a multi million dollar delaying tactic nothing more wow,who s fighting lol just pay
256,right people should stop spreading misinformation about soy,women dont stop liking toxic men until they run through about 5 of them,to russell in regards to the feminine being most commonly used to sell a product or an idea is for me is that the masculine is widely being presented as toxic and maleness is an oppressive bad thing so we now see masculine products being sold by females who are perceived as good and giving the feminine ok to this product just look at the gillette razor adverts that blatantly denounce masculinity while trying to sell products to men women are now the only ones that can be trusted to promote male products as a male selling the same product or idea would be attacked as being toxic or untrustworthy this is also why it s women are trusted to defend men s rights and speak up on behalf of men as men defending themselves is also attacked by the anti male community as toxic this also i think accounts for so many young impressionable boys that don t want to be men when they grow up due to the social vilification of men and maleness by the overwhelmingly female education systems,talking about invasive species these people who electrify and electrocute the fish are invasive species themselves up north as an invasive species they had the nerve to nail the tongue of the indigenous species offspring to the table simply because they refused to speak the invasive species language i can really see the destruction of the ecosystem such an irony some people should really take a hard look in the mirror,question from an old woman how do we have so many man babies with arrested development legit question is it all just a grift
257,it s not just soy but fermented soy fermentation in some vegetables has amazing benefits but it might still effect people with sensitive endocrine systems soy is one of the natural foods that are too volatile for human endocrine systems,i see women past 45 that stay wanting toxic men they ll never stop wanting them it s in women s nature to always respect drama dudes,is russel smart or does he just have a british accent we may never know,block the canal build a crain lift belt like a lifting bridge but different that lifts taxis the barges over the wall,both tiktok rewards that type of video fast explosive direct it s how people make their money over there say or do something wild and hope it catches the wind keep up stuff like it hope you don t get banned and make some pocket change
258,upload on rumble as well as youtube then slowly transition over there you know this isn t the last ban,how you haven t blown up and gone mainstream is beyond me hands down the best advice for men i ve ever heard,really happy to see russel have jordan on i absolutely hate how much crap people give jordan peterson in the media and on sites like reddit he s obviously not some bad guy who s trying to steal your sons and convert them to the far right jordan is hardly even right wing i don t even understand why he s labelled as the far right,why do you think there is a flow in the canal its a river which means damming it,caroline i feel ya i have no idea
259,red meat gets pumped with carbon monoxide known poison to keep that red look on it meat is dead so therefore the decaying process started once the insides were exposed to oxygen,aye a broke nigga just got a free ass book thanks steph,loved this more fashun pls,just put nets it is not like they re dinosaurs,the thing with the paying for dates is that it s from back in the day when women didn t have money of their own so obviously the guy payed
260,i agree with the muslim ban too sneako,what s your thoughts on dr dre getting divorced,wow i m female and i spend a lot of time on youtube jordan peterson just explained what my mother did wrong oh my mother did that wrong too,the way to stop it is to purge the entire river width for 50 or so yards with nitrogen the nitrogen will displace all oxygen in the water and the fish will not enter the 50 yard zone for lack of o2 simple no harmful pollutants and easy to pull off by the way the illinois river also drains into the mississippi,not completely and it s paid lol
261,i m here for the brett cooper simp videos lol i don t even know what this channel talks about other than that haha from the comments it sounds like we got some everymans man pep rally shit goin on lol just ring me when we got more brett cooper comedy lol,this why meeting girls in person first i s better cause you get to know who they really are dudes need to stop using social media to meet girls you can t believe half the stuff they post,i think masculine and feminine have been perverted twisted and manipulated by modern and post modern society both elements of the yin yang are being subverted and disrespected and both men and women are victims of this fact,shout out to peoria,very good i will probably subscribe
262,i think it s a city thing i m from philadelphia and people say the same exact things that they say to you to me i m loud i m angry i m mad something s wrong with you blah blah blah,1 2 more like 99,i taught my son how to cook clean and balance his checkbook before he left home teach your child independence personal strength and not to listen to other people s opinions of who you are and what you should be be true to yourself first,i don t care because it s funny,i think that the man should pay for the date but by the man i mean the patriarchy
263,especially you bro you are coping and also feminine,dr dre divorced his wife and she getting 400 milly,yes we teach our sons this and of course we should but do we teach them to do diy work on their car fishing hunting and be able to solve problems that our granddads used to solve not so much and the girls can as usual do as they want,it makes you wonder if something similar could be used off beaches to prevent shark attacks obviously safety would need to be ensured i have thoughts on how but smarter people than me i am sure could come up with a safe and effective method,right first off anytime a man speaks about his feelings they are used against him and no one gives a shyt anyway so why bother any time i have opened up to another person i have always regretted it later secondly about the whole relationship thing not everyone is even meant for relationships if people want to live their own life how they like for their own reasons what business is it of anybody else s lastly we have reached the point where true understanding and compromise is impossible and i have resolved to simply stop caring about things that don t affect me personally doesn t affect me then not my problem popcorn
264,shneako looking like he is on 3g of white powder,ik y all ass didn t really turn yo phone upside down to look at the 3 or 4,great life lessons truly important stuff that just isn t taught in schools way to go,if they can place toxins in the water to kill all fish and there are no long lasting effects they should use this technique to eliminate every last carp they they can reintroduce the native species of fish and put things right again,maybe find better people to be around me my family my friends and my lover talk about our feelings a lot and it gets personal often and at times dark dont blame society like this when its clear that the people around you aren t healthy and or mature enough to have these types of talks
265,you need to get out of the house my g,there are living in la la land man alternate reality,the most masculine men have a feminine soul the most feminine women have a masculine soul dr cg jung,why not let people fish them more than usual the carp market would go down but hell you got you some fish outa your lakes,it s such a stupid thing to say that women don t marry who they want that s not even slightly true not even a bit this isn t 1889 women don t have to marry who we are told to anymore men ask typically and we say yes or not men are still the ones doing most of the asking for sex and for marriage we are still the ones answering their request
266,what does refugess have to do with this,alternate reality word,devouring mother best possible example in pop culture pink floyd mother context is lyrics check out the song mother do you think they ll drop the bomb mother do you think they ll like the song mother do you think they ll try to break my balls ooh mother should i build the wall mother should i run for president mother should i trust the government mother will they put me in the firing line ooh is it just a waste of time hush now baby baby don t you cry mama s gonna make all of your nightmares come true mama s gonna put all of her fears into you mama s gonna keep you right here under her wing she won t let you fly but she might let you sing mama s gonna keep baby cosy and warm ooh baby ooh baby ooh baby of course mama s gonna help build the wall mother do you think she s good enough for me mother do you think she s dangerous to me mother will she tear your little boy apart ooh ah mother will she break my heart hush now baby baby don t you cry mama s gonna check out all your girlfriends for you mama won t let anyone dirty get through mama s gonna wait up until you get in mama will always find out where you ve been mama s gonna keep baby healthy and clean ooh baby ooh baby ooh baby you ll always be baby to me mother did it need to be so high,makes you laugh they want folks to lessen their power consumption all whilst using loads to solve problems they made humans an animal that got worse pretending it s not an animal,have you tried to roast them red piller live myron is doing a podcast every week or so or have you tried debating better bachelor or steven crowder perhaps or christina h picking at some low hanging fruits from tik toks doesn t make you any better as a matter of fact this is the same behavior as them pick a random video and start ranting and never give them a chance to reply or defend their points all this really does is virtue signaling to females and appeal to their vanity quite disingenuous really
267,i need to check my testosterone at least 3000,if she s not giving you anything don t stick around for her dry words because the longer you wait the more she sees you for the simp that you are they are such savages they will text you good morning after they just got dug out by a dude who didn t even kissed her goodbye,we need more brave and heroic men like this society has been missing it for awhile now,have you thought about a net,i ve said this in some other videos of his it s why he been called out by some breadtube people noah is legit a part of the very problem
268,is soy sauce the same lol,but what s wrong with that i would appreciate a good morning here and there lol,masculinity is being driven from all aspects of society and will continue to be so until the day it s needed,i feel like a dam and fish ladder would be easier,_ feeeemaaales _
269,how do you not have a million subscribers,i got this bih in my rotation shes straight up always saying she like me i make her shy she s submissive but she real flakey at times so i hold my ground she a 10 10 colombian i don t get this bih,the thing i like most about russel is his openess he plays with and explores with ideas he doesn t seek moral superiority and he s not judgmental at all i don t agree with him in a lot bit he s an honest person searching for the truth,pc to an external monitor and i m watcnice tutorialng tnice tutorials video on one screen and working through exactly what michael is doing and it is a big,the video was good until you said zelensky
270,good meat pause,she probably testing you to see if your gonna get attached be careful brotha just keep firm,easily one of the gayest conversations of all times,why is carp such a funny word,lmfaooo the tom and jerry part definitely made me loose it
271,just got my moobs cut out cost hella money and my confidence as a kid and teenager it s been 2 weeks hasn t fully healed yet but my confidence and posture is up like it should ve been years ago the estrogen and high prolactin levels on top of being raised by women and being addicted porn is what s killing our manhood,hahaaaaaa i totally hear ya bruh,this channel is falling into the age old conservative grift it s sad to see,what i dont understand is how this is harmful other things lived there now carp do natural selection,so i used to have a friend who had a crush on me and we were pretty close i didn t know she had feelings so i was oblivious the whole time but we were friends since middle school my boyfriend knew but didn t try to make me stop being friends with her we called eachother wife as a joke and he politely asked me not to do that but that s it he didn t say if you loved me you d drop her or anything ike that we eventually stopped being friends and he told me he trusted me so he didn t worry about it at all i love that guy
272,im 17 and i have moobs idk what to do,hi steph thank you for your content i really enjoy learning your perspective and teachings i apply it in my life now i even get hype myself when you yell through the internet on getting on our passion and purpose radical self mastery your message is deeper than the surface have a good one,jordan looks healthy glad to have him back,so the billions of dollars would be wasted on someone ignorant enough to just up and dump some live carp into the great lakes then huh,matthew is not red pill idk why you d include him
273,how dare you white soy boys why they gotta be white oh that s right most of them are white i think destiny is their leader,wat up james harden i mean steph lol,this might be the gayest thing ive ever seen,are they not ediable,in the next part of matthew hussey s video he says that if a man doesn t offer to pay he wasn t raised right i ve seen people respond to the video more than once
274,fuck soy tbh even on a cut i stay miles away from the stuff soy souse doesn t count right,facts but you re talking about full on hoes every girl has hoe instinct and wants multiple males but after a certain point women do want an alpha male to settle with and at that point cheating isn t an issue for a lot of relationships even on the women s end the difference is that their version of hoe ing out is just leaving you but if you re alpha during the relationship she ll stay cuz everyone wants to settle eventually if you don t you re fuckin weird,even if you don t agree with russell you have to respect his thought process i ve got mad respect for him now the gears are definitely turning in his head keep up the great work,do the us army core of engineers not wear uniforms are they part of the regular army,that stupid quote about marriage and sex in men vs women is so dumb and makes you come to the only conclusion these guys wives are settling for them not the flex they think it is
275,put this guy in a debate with destiny and watch how quickly sneako resorts to simply rolling his eyes or making smug generalisations rather than engage in a mature discussion,because they are all toxic themselves man they just concealing it when they met you then turn into a exorcists afterwards,no i m right no i m right just an offering of ideas and arguments about those ideas with the genuin want to get to a better understanding of things i think those two are some of the people with the highest developed form of communication culture,everyone minding their own business and having a normal conversation me a complete stranger wanting to listen to what they re saying 0 03,do you ever think that this kind of roast the incels videos from bread tube only bring validation to the red pill manosphear fandom by validating the underdog image that they so often try to portray themselfs as
276,these guys are in the entertainment business they all do it destiny does it too destiny d rider,this guy is funny as hell looool,russell is starting to look more and more like peter sutcliffe,tom should swim in it,mwaa goodbye god no ah where was my consent for that one not in your earholes the nerve of this ma uh du um jerk anyway love you noah mwaa
277,why is it the only ones labelled insane misogynist etc etc etc that actually have any integrity,they fear judgement from men about their promiscuity then brag to their girls how many dug her out,youtube audience is mostly men where are all the girls at,what about fish eggs carried by birds,and sadly there women who literally think like these men
278,happy birthday goat,no women is single if she is somewhat attractive or decent if she tells you she is single don t believe her she has dudes digging her out and dudes she goes out with for free meals and attention,one of the best quotes i heard lately testosterone is what makes men enjoy pain and suffering,just let the chinese take care of the problem,the one who asks pays
279,man the world has become strange,this is facts some chick i was seeing tried to pull that card on me but it ain t work,you want to talk about masculinity get don frye on there lol,there are millions of dollars of goods that traverse just through this area alone he says as a freight train goes through that could carry the same goods,if someone feels the need to control manipulate and emotionally damage another person they don t need to be in a relationship my husband and i fully respect each other and our emotions he never tried to control me at any point in our relationship and when it comes to our emotions both of us support each other and rely on each other for understanding we know we can come to each other when we are going through something i absolutely support men talking about their feelings and being open but this manosphere crap is really pushing a dangerous narrative i m a survivor of dv and sa and a lot of these tactics they are talking about are very similar and sometimes spot on with dv men shouldn t be watching these videos and thinking this is the way to act around women if you feel so insecure in a relationship that you feel you need to control every aspect of the woman s life then you are not ready to be in a relationship point blank
280,first fourty eight,tunning in all the way kampala uganda thanx bro,fact check 56 of youtube users are male and 44 are female not 80 20 like jordan peterson suggested it s a fluke is just a lie,just put this on the border problem solved,red pill you mean low intelligence squad
281,i started using only soy milk becous my doctor said it would be good for my skin but it didn t improved my skin what happens was that i was getting gyno man boobs i then stoped eating soy an they are now slowly going away so stay away from soy,i actually met a girl that said she only wanted to have sex with me me and that s all we did for 4 months lol,the last person who should be speaking about masculinity is jordan fucking peterson,wait speed hump hahahah,everything in the lives of these men is about women putting them down
282,what do you guys actually gain from spreading such obvious bs hahaha i really can t understand it,that s dope,jordan is so well spoken it s like the art of communicating an idea,would harvesting carp for fertilizer work,submite to u basically she has to sell her soul to this fuck and not breath without asking him
283,thats bs lol,i m still jamming to that intro beat,this is fun you two should talk all the time,leave it to the government to create a problem that only they can fix but in the end exacerbates the situation thus requiring more taxpayer dollars and more liberties encroached upon,wren is fucking genius monetize people s guilt lol
284,it s the white liberals they r all nuts,is there honestly much point getting into a relationship sounds like un needed hassle,wow ladies and gentlemen this is what a truly intellectual conversation looks like between two great thinkers how rear to hear a conversation like this anywhere these days,this make the cheep cheep fish from mario games look like an understatement,i find the mentality of being controlling towards your partner as a means to combat the potential they might cheat to be super extra insane in a way a lot of people don t often point out if your so would cheat on you if given the opportunity then your relationship is already deeply toxic and damaged it s a relationship that you should be able to acknowledge isn t working it s a relationship that you shouldn t want to continue you should always feel comfortable with trusting your partner around others and if you don t you should consider deeply why you feel that way
285,the reason your high energy and they hate it is the alpha in you don t change and conform to the matrix while these clowns have,if you not ready it def is bro they have so many expectations it s always good in the beginning,russell brand is the single best human on earth to get into discussion with jordan peterson,power failure ecological disaster,if she cannot submit to yewww and the things you want her to dewww shes not for yewww ok dr sewwws
286,who s that british sounding guy with a world map behind him,women love tall handsome men they don t care if you re toxic or not it s not a priority to them face height and race skin tone also the rest barely makes a difference the cope has to stop,the holy trinity i believe was taken from paganism the maiden mother and crone,i am sorry to say this but this kind of solution will fail sooner or later nature can not be contained,noah where s the fucking kitty
287,you want to get banned so bad but nobody cares d,face height muscles,oh no ive been an ursela wow the end of this video i needed to see,imagine being in the wild and seeing a water source and then you get zapped,i think the one good take in the other side is the guy talking about dating and who should pay if you go out with someone it d be nicer if everyone assumed they d be paying that way you both have that nice moment when you realize someone was willing to pay for your dinner if you just assume your food will be paid for it s kinda demeaning for the other person so maybe we all could just like not do that
288,bro seems like he s on stimulants,women will continue to say in public that they want a guy with no 304s but we all know the truth as long as a man has women chasing after him that woman will forever desire him,sex sells is an imposed societal standard the dark side is using this in their consumerism crap to mask spirit our truth and sell ego girls believe that beauty comes in an over priced bottle of tinted crap they put all over their face to look better than the chick next door one upper society beauty lives in the heart where god lives you can be the prettiest person in the world until you open your mouth exposing a dark closed off heart its sad and infuriating,so you re saying i should let my pet fish go free on the lake side of that project you know somebody is going to do the unthinkable just a matter of time billy what happened to those fish i had we freed them daddy free,hop goblin lol
289,you respect genuine people that deserve it like aba and preach regardless of their stance i respect that regardless of your stances,beta male voice uhm stephooooooooooooonnnnnnnnn what does 304 mean,please talk to zizek,now i know how to gurantee my death jump in that water,someone peg these misogynists
290,isn t half of all asia having soy based everything lol,what does it mean,this is such a cool conversation to watch and listen to thanks russell,animation studios after watching this write that down write that down tbh i also feel like it would make a great plot for a animated movie like what if a baby fish escaped from there and born on a complety different river but can t go past the barrier,25 43
291,this soy shit has already been proven to have no basis in reality yet people are still yelling about it what the fuck,weird how one girl in my past acted like she really wanted to fw me but i never did because i had this instinct that she s a 304 and just didn t validate her never gave her the time of day nothing,work on your own masculinity none of you are eligible to consider himself as masculine,this water will electrify and kill you shows seagulls landing on water,20 58 where did this idea come from that men are supposed to pay the more i think about it the more i tend to think it came from a time where men made more money than women anyone else have any ideas or know where this came from
292,do you guys want him on rumble,304 ima use that,even the camera had to blink cos that hit deep camera woah,will the eggs of those fish also get electrocuted,well you re mostly right men however still make more the gender pay gap was and still is a real thing however the further back you go the more difficult it was for a woman to be financially independent as recently as 1950 s america for instance women were often refused their own bank account either they were expected to have one gifted to them by a parent usually the father or expected to use their husband s this wasn t universally true of course but it was common enough that it gave rise to a whole pile of stereotypes and gender norms that persist to this day
293,u tha man sneako these blue guys just tryna be superman and believe in them disney happy endings,women have no logic damn that s crazy but true i ve seen it,but is the feminine traits in men not just as important the focus seem to be focused the masculine some man could do with more subtleness and gentleness,6 27 sure we know the best thing to do is close the false waterway we created but we re too greedy to worry about that there s money to be made and we want to drive mercedes benz,18 10 why does he always emphasize the bitch like the margaret thatcher is dead video
294,sneako making a reaction video to people dropping reaction videos about him and then clowning that they re making reaction videos when he s doing the same thing wild,she never say it but her actions always show it that was ladies and gentlemen from stephlscold bar tho,the push down of masculinity in men and women is to make the state father it s a power grab,carpe carpe seize the fish,the girl i m talking to is helping me get over a lot of past trauma by telling me i m not my past almost daily these dudes are just insecure fuckheads
295,eyebrow slits are feminine,steph i had a good laugh when you were explaining to them what a 304 is oh i m dead,i really like jordan peterson and i m an atheist,how are the carp easily startled if they have no predators,1st dude if she does not submit to you everyone with a brain okay now hold your horses
296,how come,steph a real ass nigga,nothing better than a couple of youtube gurus arguing about what neither of them knows anything about who saw this happening,what if someone brings carp in a car past it,from all us sarahs fuck you too noah jk
297,we love you sneako,there s really people that asked what a 304 is,as the only male in my son s upringing his teachers doctors etc are all female i m def his male role model someone has to protect him from the toxic ways of femininity and gender ideology,youtube needs to recommend more educational and informative videos like this to everyone although this particular one would not relate to audiences across the board but the human mind is curious i think the population would benefit greatly,these guys are the exact type of guys that a majority of women and girls avoid at all cost
298,what soy milk is my fave tho this whole time,i been hearing this lot so l got to check this video out,until people understand that language dictates thought these misinterpretations will continue to plague mankind,why can t they simply use a big net,5 03 you do realize there are other toms and jerrys in the world right
299,hey brotha you were speaking facts on f f the other night bro keep it up,it s better to be single and happy than in a relationship and miserable,firstly eat more food and you will become a bigger and a more mascular man in addition men only have concerns about masculinity because they are too light and they have been educated to eat less food and remain light and lean furthermore their is a massive difference between a heavy man that eats a huge amount of food and a lean man that small amount of food this will create some masculinity concerns for the lean men and they can get frustrated with their lower masculinity therefore if you feel that your masculinity is falling to low it will make you feel better to eat two dinners every day for half a year,carp have taken out many natural aust freshwater fish types amazing to see the infrastructure tasks the us army engineers have completed,seems clear to me that these men had a traumatic experience with girls and they are projecting their traumas and insecurities to the young tiktok audience as a person that really struggle dating i would like to say that even in frustration i try to have a balanced and rational perspective of the whole situation
300,what donald trump is to late night talk shows sneako is to reaction creators,amen bro,i made it up,six point zero,personally i love being for the streets
301,man this aint no place for no hero,facts even rollo said that,that statement about the pervasive advertising yes all we have is shopping having sex has even been taken from us,i still don t understand how it works and why birds can touch the water,i don t like it when men pay the tab for dates because it always feels like they expect something from me in return i always ask to split it on a first date
302,comment sections cucks don t realise meat and milk contain real estrogen that is identical to female hormone phitoestrogen have nothing to do with estrogen it s just the chemical name for it,purpose over everything else,belly bounce,we have carp bottom feeders in pennsylvania clarion river for sure and the lakes let s hope there are none but i doubt there isn t,some darn good maplestoey
303,my conspiracy theory s gut telling me that those demon worshipper put something in our water sources and massive liberal media propaganda of course however they don t need to secretly poisoning us anymore because are you sure that thing injected to your body is a real vaccine come on we know they blatantly announced their plan about population control in world economy forum in davos right,from the mark 3 55 till 4 06 that is key,we are the result of our own life experiences it s done when the mobile phone replaces parents then things go wrong it was not so long ago that an engineer told me he did not like emancipated women is it related to the man s masculinity i myself thrive best in the company of men than to talk about for example women s things such as reading gossip newspapers cleaning washing dishes etc and even if i am purity myself and live a healthy life very boring topics that do not inspire my brain at all it s just as boring to talk about money too zzz how does the following proverb relate to masculinity or is it about contempt for women where it considers the woman to be less worthy than the man emancipated women do not need to emancipate themselves they are not as good as men the whole emancipation rumor has not changed that women make themselves beautiful to please men the preference of men for full beard is linked to the emancipation of women because even the most emancipated woman does not come with the full beard and finally why do men around the world abuse and murder women what is the purpose of it do not misinterpret me i like men but not those who treat women badly they have no place in my life at all i could never be with a man who abuses women to feel masculine,i ll have fish and a rice cake then i ll have me fish,dude i love you videos so much
304,your t levels change on daily basis theres nothing wrong with soy as long as you restabalize your t levels afterwards eat some steak raw onion eggs go workout get plenty of sleep etc the problem is them sneaking it into every product we buy that way were forced to overconsume it without knowing literally the other day i bought little ceasars pizza and one of the ingredients was soy pizza doesnt even need soy,steph keep keeping it,normal people unity russell uni e,are they not eatable make a business out of it or ask the chinese they know how to outfish the oceans,thanks for this btw
305,dawg same shit with my wtf does it need soy for i these everyday bc i m not old enough to be buying my own shit yet plus fam balls on a budget so ramen just convenient asf but chose to read the ingredients after all the talking about i and no more microwaved ramen for me back thing is i doubt they did this to mircowaved food in the late 90s and early 2000s,_mother said from a young age dont trust her words watch her actions _,great pod cast love jordan peterson,catch and export,when i think about it why should men hide feelings from women when they probablyyy know how to deal w it better than us
306,sneako youre a woke soy boy you speak the right message your just the wrong messenger,and vice versa,of course i m glad he fills the role of a pseudo intellectual the world need more thinkers but have y all seen him in get him to the greek comedic legend right there,i don t know why they don t offer bounties for the fish and allow those of us who love fishing a way to make money fishing,i used to follow these guys a lot n watching this vid now makes me realize that it was probablyyy just me being insecure n lonely and never feeling the touch of a woman
307,hey shneako new sub i came from hamzas followers first i saw your feud but i really dont care about who were you now you interact again with my boy adonis and i got interest in your content new sub from ecuador,she must be a real one,i would love a night of chatting and drinking beer with these fellas i imagine we all would get our words in and have an interesting rational challenging and respectful conversation even though i am not on their level of ability unlike the screaming non debates and rants we tend to see and hear these days,why dont they just over fish that specific area and lower the carps population,so that s pretty poggers
308,wait so is soy sauce going to lower my testosterone too cause if so i m going to have some issues,what should i do she said she doesn t want to be in a relationship for now although we were before and had some issue,ah yes lets listen to the gender reversos about their opinion on masculinity,so much for selling the asian carp at a buck each,i really noticed all the shiz that men get for being something more than a robotic wallet when i came out as a trans guy it hurts especially since people will use anything that i do that isn t hyper masculine as an excuse to say i m not trans enough
309,it s because most men now a days buy into the bs that women spew that men have to be in touch with their feminine side and the funny part is that they hate men who are in touch with their feminine side lolz that s hilarious which further proves that women don t know what they want,still lookin for that opening track,russell please please please do a video on the netflix documentary seaspiracy,dude this is nothing our polish government dumped mercury into odra river how _metal_ is that,i like u make fun of people who dont think the same as u do noah i bet u get triggered for the fact there are men who dont want chicks who has participated in hookup culture then again its a free world and some simps wont mind but some people do however i think its way better being honest with yourself and having a serious discussion with one self and make up your mind on certain topics and not be group pressured into believing something one does not believe in of course that also comes with not hating on people who believes the opposite u do i dont want a chick that sleept with anyone cuz im a vrigin and so i expect my gf to be aswell im not gonna change that standard for literally besides dont give me the crap about not being sexually compatible i think i comes down to both parties being honest again and a clear communication i just think its honestly sad too see u make fun of everything however shows me no personality wheres your thoughts on this and that got none i mean u cant be serious for even a second its really sad too afraid of upsetting ur fan base or what like come one man grow a pair and say something u agree with the opposite instead of always disagreeing it makes no sense cuz it seems like u believe in either black or white and that conecpt exludes the grey parts in the world that exists i honestly get triggered when people like u dont even try to have a serious discussion just gaslighting and strawmaning every agrument someone puts on the table this worlds sucks ass but mostly the women do
310,men dont have one,i can t even play dumb with women they can sense that i know they lying lol even when i have a poker face and they be calling me out on it,great example of the positive feminine is the female elf ring bearer in lord of the rings,human civilization is most dangerous thing to earth ever,great work the additional audio sounds for a joke are so well placed they re hilarious
311,damnnnn this video was bad,gold i can t play dumb it s just not in me i call it for what i see it as and it shows in my energy even when i say nothing,this is such a joke,because they want hunt the fishes,he has a moustache no man can argue with
312,was depressed for 8years started bc of some scummy female that just did me dirty then i never really did anything abt it to fix myself then i got into drugs and had a genuine chemical in balance up in me head there but finally over the last few months after watching sneak i fixed myself started working out eating better food like fruit good meat other healthy shit and im no longer depressed that easy to get my shit together been sober for 2 years now and im fucking happy its great,maybe you re tone of voice or avoiding eye contact or somethin,russel i would love to hear your thoughts on unschooling homeschooling to be you encompass a self directed learner driven by motivation it has been super interesting to follow your development these last years thanks for great content a lot of laughs and your great way of challenging normal i know it is a long shot but we would love to interview you for our upcoming podcast series,more human intervention causing irreversible damage to our ecosystems surprise surprise,lovely stash bro
313,ai wifebots and synthetic will replace women 2030,soak in everything steph is saying cuz i promise u everything he say is true salute bro,i respect the hell outta russell brand cause he has civil discussions with people i usually disagree with him but that s what i respect there s nothing wrong with disagreements that s normal also so glad to see jordan peterson back at it and doing well,i sure hope they don t collectively evolve into guaradoses,that amazon forest project is amazing i just needed to say that definitely gonna check out wren
314,we have the same story but for me it was 4 years thank god i found sneako and hamza,the answer is simple because their toxic as they say like attracts like,here s the thing when you build the masculine in women it will repeal masculine men in romantic relationships it s the balance of the feminine woman and masculine man polarity that works so well together in the long run,how they cleaned dead fish,despite everything i think this kind of response is valuable sure some of these men are too far gone to be affected but coherently laying down exactly how with so much patience can only be good for people on a healthier path we all have a lot to work on and hearing this helps counter the normalization of harmful views
315,w come up story not woke just awake,there we go first nug of truth in these comments,6 18 cool,we love chicago,care more is an interesting concept of itself we had to have this discussion my husband and i i feel my emotions more than others and he feels them less than others we like to think of it as having different health bars from video games i have a larger health bar than him so while my love is more as in stronger we love each other with the same percentage rate of our health bar although his health bar is smaller than others he is an amazing and thoughtful life partner and friend
316,classic jabaited tea w,super facts bro i like to listen to their subconscious mind which is what they just blurt out saying out of nowhere you can t always control it,if people keep feeding the world with ignorance and selfishness there will be no meaningful future inequalities discrimination violence and war this is what happens when we don t care about each other so don t be fools and wake up and pay attention start now actually use your voice and talk about meaningful conversation civilization depends on us getting back to listening to learn and talking to be heard away with the selfish life of social media and the news peer away and it s not as hard as you think,why won t a net work,way too much commentary in between clips the in between sections drag on way too long here
317,i m glad to hear that pal keep the good work and live the moment also i suggest you to watch the rational male vids,dont be toxic be indifferent before i started watching this channel i was always the odd kid in school and in college now if everyone was sitting on the left side of the classroom i would sit on the other side just because to stand out girls always looked at me and paid attention even though the guy with charm was over there they would just gravitate towards me and every day one girl would move desks but slowly making her way closer to me because i was set apart and was focused on my work genuinely didnt want to sit where everyone was distracting me from hearing the lesson in class indifference beats charm charisma and any other trait any day if you know the weather forecast for the whole week than you know how to plan accordingly but if you didnt know the weather ahead of time you would always be wondering when its going to rain same with women,the expression of females in consumerism as an extension or act of worship is hogwash the commercialization of women is more often than not limited to child looking women who have no resonance of a woman or her body the societal expectations for young girls are reflected on this false narrative and impact the psyche of the young woman the disconnected imagery starts an act of self hatred in young women the most common imagery is exploited women who malnourish their bodies and subject themselves to sexual abuse from wealthy men instead of commercializing smart women who are attractive regardless of size the focus is on a few wealthy men s image of beauty which is teenager they can control or tell what to do epstein really had his hands in a lot of things and or did well for a reason,great job bringing more attention to this issue as always,i love it when you find some guys lol
318,goat keep it up,hell yeah homie,if modern liberals were like russell there would not be an exodus,i wonder what their plans are if this is no longer going to work cause you know they have contingency plans and they re probably very extreme,oh boy more guys
319,mad props my boy,i purposely act indidferent it drives them crazy and draw them to you oh i have they head spinning or thinking about seeing a psychiatrist,but here s the big secret every realm had the same form of health and sickness as every other realm that s why no realm can dominate or control another every top has the same type of dignity and identical privilege with different reflections that reflect the distinct realms that s how god and me are equal we each represent a type of zenith in distinct realms and each realm holds a key that prevents any one from dominating another and when each key is achieved each realm knows why dominance isn t to be desired when one learns from other cultures it might not change anything immediately but it does remove resentment and create solutions and acceptance and courage and eliminated needy cravings that caused oppression sharing wisdom makes the world better inevitably,what if the power goes off its bound to happen sometime,please talk more about menslib
320,bro when i quit it took weeks to get out of withdrawal my rule now is anything than be sniffed must be avoided so anyone who pulls drugs out i gotta go cause i m gonna want to do them,first comment i ve read that describe my situation you see for people like you and me it s about us all the time if people want to come in our world the door is open if not go as you please we simply are living our own life and that is the key to living a serene and peaceful one,learning at the majority of youtube viewers are male makes a lot more sense based on how the majority of the media i consume on this platform tends to not even recognize that women are just people have we come to consider that maybe the whole thing is a spectrum and that masculine versus feminine is just another part of the patriarchy like russell says that masculinity is synonymous with power and how about that that sex work is illegal and yet a woman can be hired to represent a company in a certain way to convey the emotion that the soulless economy wishes it could represent please wake up and realize we re all just humans in meat sacks who don t have the right to judge any body thank you russell when the time comes i would love to have you help found a religion that is not a religion just considered a religion for the sake of economic and lawful reasons in this broken country that doesn t value individuals and bodily autonomy without something written in the law to say that some god will smite them if they don t allow the religious to not get a vaccine or it s only work a certain amount of hours per week the system itself needs to stop being upheld so thank you very much russell i as a woman who would be unable to thrive on this planet without my own firm belief of value and autonomy because everything else in this society is so vehemently against that in order to sell me something to make me think i am finally worthy hear you and appreciate you,why don t they trawl the waters dry of fish with large nets,the celest music is iconic thanks sir for that
321,it s amazing how you re entire life will change just from getting healthy,js399 whatever makes you feel alpha do it and you become alpha alpha is about pursuing your own true nature despite the pressures of the many different voices in society consequently these voices have all sorts of ideas about how you should life your life and what you should care or not care about if you sit down at the empty side to stand out because you feel like standing out your alpha if you re sitting on the empty side for any other reason you have now let societies voices guide you instead of your own also the most alpha thing you can do is sit besides someone and say hi how are you and not care what the response may be whether pleasant or disagreeable to yourself or them simply because you want to start a conversation with that person,how did this guy become so based not doing narcotics 24 hrs a day probably helps much respect to rb i m sure he gets flack from the rainbow mob all the time for his normal views on humanity,whats to prevent joe blow to drop some fish into the great lake,i think alpha male critique mock and analysis videos are always good for you creator cause its such an easy topic to elaborate and for us the viewers cause shit s entertaining go get that bag bro
322,if i could add more do not date nor married divorced single mothers i m grateful for my child but if you aren t happy it s harder to be a good parent you have to fake it sometimes for the sake of child s mental health it gets tougher,l bro only girls sit near me if some guy comes up i alpha him out of the class then all the girls cheer,i just saw a clip of mr peterson and his husband mr peterson should stop talking about masculinity because if he s married to that it means he has no clue what it is holy hell,this may sound like a dumb idea but is it not possible to find another species to hunt the carp or would it not be possible to literally dredge and clean the waters somehow,i got that though the fire and flames on expert reference so i must engage as is prescribed in the writings of old and my axe mr samsen and my axe
323,i m glad for you bro idk what happened but ur on the right path i pray for you and keep growing as a person,as a woman i agree 100,or maybe the commodification in consumerism makes the light available to allow men to embody the feminine independently of having access to a spouse women taught me that it s more important to build my own world through consumerism than to be attached to the feminine by need of the feminine consumerism actually would make it possible to mitigate and make prostitution less a thing if a man can own his own spiritual sexuality then women wouldn t have that debt to men which actually liberates women basically men can t respect women unless they don t need women and the sad thing is women had been conditioned to believe that being needed and being respected are the same thing and they re not which is why women have had a tendency to oppress themselves to show how needed they are and that s how women held themselves back because of confusing need with respect respect is more secure than need but women have seemed to have been taught that if she is needed then she is secure and that s a logical fallacy because need created neediness in men that created spiritual poverty in men that created an abusive relationship of some males relationship to women that women themselves had created in part i say in part not to blame because women had been victimized to some degree but identifying as a victim means that a woman s pride as victim is what keeps a woman a spiritual prisoner and the good news of that is that a woman can just walk out of that prison at will in my private life i ve sometimes been hard on the female perspective in relating the traps of some women to men but my point with that is it doesn t matter what who did to who be strong and protect yourself and it s better for all involved to dismiss victim narratives because those narratives often had the argument that because this or that group had been hurt that you should just let yourself be hurt and that s just fucking stupid that s not natural there s something animalistic and righteous in dismissing the past and respecting ones own humanity then human decency has a blank slate and that s something only individuals can give themselves the logical fallacy of the koran though as interpreted by some is that it s logically impossible to make the world into a world wide caliphate because that assumed that gods work with everyone else was a mistake that needed to be erased and that s arrogant that directly contradicts the best value of middle eastern culture which is humility humility implies a willingness to learn listen and grow with other human beings not control or dominate other human beings white people have had a past the best wisdom of white culture is that light shines naturally when home is honored and not earned cherished white history and past racism had contradicted that value but that doesn t mean that value isn t there because it is simplifying value of the family makes great cultural achievements versailles and several other shameless over expensive buildings weren t built for the sake of oppression the spiritual debt there was there and couldn t not be there part of the tragedy of human history but using that temporary moment of injustice to make something beautiful is one step of grace to eliminate injustice black culture is one of strength and resilience shaka zulu created a mythology of warriors who could walk anywhere because their feet had no shoes but that same formlessness led to an arrogance that seemed to confuse strength with valuing nothing one strong black man once said love was a weakness and that s wrong but i also listened to his insights love needs to incorporate business sense or love is weak that was me being willing to listen and respect black insight to strengthen my relationship with my own cultural insight about home and the clarity that inevitability brings and the sense of humility and willingness to fearlessly learn from someone else that would possibly be the best form of middle eastern culture courage is something all cultures share to prevent catastrophe i m the anomaly in white culture my wisdom has had a natural prince of darkness quality and as a cultural exchange in the nineteenth century i traveled to africa and functioned as a priest with shaka zulu for future mutual benefit we created a common mind of mutual wisdom thats what happened,you re gonna kill birds too,btw for the hitler made good art angle just a reminder he fully lacked understanding of perspective he would just draw what he saw
324,w bro congratulations man,woooooooah this guy got girls to sit next to him in class omg alpha,the enemies of the masculine in men are also the enemies of the masculine in women i actually disagree with jordan here i believe the enemies of the masculine in men do so to promote and prop up the masculinity in women i think its the femininity in women that s being persecuted not the masculinity,why not catch them in giant nets and use them as the much needed fertilizer in our farming industry large cranes on each sid of the canal could lower their nets until full of fish then raise the catch and swing the haul to one side to be loaded into waiting trailers for delivery to the fertilizer plant where they would be initially processed through large chippers similar to wood chippers in a papermill then slurried into a drying and packaging plant the initial investment would be huge but the profits would be enormous considering what fertilizer cost these days many large farms would probably accept the slurry in tankers to be directly applied to their acreage back at the canal you would need several locations along the canal to insure while one net is being harvested another one upstream or down straem would be ready to catch the fish if a vessel needs passage the nets could be raised in turn to allow it access,right off the bat with the first video i hope that women who interact with these types of men know that they too are not for them they don t have to change themself or be less than to be with someone because there are mature men with more open mindsets out there i know our ability to comprehend differs per individual but i honestly had no clue there were so many men and women who had no idea what a healthy relationship looked like
325,happy for u bro,isn t that basically attention seeking doing indifferent stuff just bcz to get attention from women even that indifferent stuff don t give anything to you,it s insane how people think dr peterson is the equivalent of a nazi,i did a major report on this for a senior research project for my civil and environmental engineering degree it the carp make it into lake michigan it would be absolutely an disaster and devastate the great lakes fisheries,the last guy who was all about paying for date is disgusting me if he s asking for sex in return for his paying what if woman paying for the date and she should ask for return i wish someone asked him this
326,what foods to eat and where to get them help a nigga out,that was a smooth transition remain indifferent to be a mystery,he s just a quack,hey tom can you tell me when this footage with the boat passing through beginning at about the 4 00 mark was filmed would like to know if it was my husband at the helm thanks for the information i always hear about the fish barrier but never knew details be safe,at that point why not just pay a sex worker lol
327,that s great but remember not all women are bad and also don t rely on sneako for your gains as true progress comes from within,i relate to this heavyyy so i hear you bro it s an edge that very few have,immediately jordan peterson has someone who can make sound arguments he tries to not sound like a complete moron,you should ask him somewhere he ll more likely see it,it s fair so wth are you saying
328,the being sober part was prior to watching sneako but the working out eating good food really solidified it and im more motivated than ive ever been,be good looking,56 of global youtube users are male 44 of global youtube users are female,disturbing nature,did that guy say no big bro sir are you ok edit oh ok it got worse
329,average sneako w,indifference mystery,users yes viewers in most major categories though are male,would a curtain of oxygen bubbles not hold the fish back just a thought,i pray no woman has to go through such a controlling relationship forcing such extreme change upon someone is the base formula for a disaster
330,bro what s wrong with microwaves though,7 43,what a healthy discussion,bruh jackson ms has like flint mi has a serious crisis still they have growing critical issues with access to clean water and the ms army national guard is currently occupying their municipal water systems to hopefully clear debris and get water to the mississippians who have been told to shower with the toxic water with their mouths closed they are living without clean water to wash cook or flush toilets,the funniest thing about all of these loser dudes giving dating advice is that they re giving it to men already struggling to find dates and telling them to do things that will make them even less dateable then of course they assume it s the fault of women and not their own terrible behavior and beliefs unless you find a girl with really low self esteem which we do know they re looking for sadly because they can t handle anything else she s not going to date you she has plenty of other options
331,boy what narcissism does to a mf,steph give your thoughts on the adam ali situation,men are more similar to women then not compared to what,don t swim in that water,honestly we really need to drop the men should pay bulls it it s been hurting our case long enough and there is no basis or excuse for it i ve never once let a date pay for me unless i know i can get them back next time then again _all_ of this feels pretty the straights are at it again
332,guys u know that soy doesn t affect the testosterone in any significant level stop listetning to some clown screaming and just check for yourself,what if being a nice guy beta is the toxic behavior that turns women off and being a man doing your shit not giving them all your time maintaining frame making yourself the priority is the healthy behavior they are looking for,you realize that men and women have 98 9 identical genetic code right so they are very similar,are they not edible to humans and what about bringing in more fish eating birds to balance the situation naturally,lmao nacht der untoten lv99 eyaaaaaa
333,this man is the definition of top g,yes this is true as a women i don t really like men that smother me i love attention but i love it more when i can see a man on his shit and has his own life,i don t always agree with russell but i respect him but man burns aren t masculine at all,this problem was caused by introducing a species into an environment with ample food and no natural predators i d hazard a guess that the problem won t be fixed by doing the same thing again also i m no fisherman but from what i understand catching all of the fish isn t easy,why are alpha men always so obsessed about their women submitting to them are they really that insecure
334,the soy boy s mustache looks fake,it s a toxic behavior until the nice guy is the only viable option as a replacement step dad to her kids after she becomes single mom after being ran through and hit the wall fucking with all of these fuck boys left to be scraps or leftovers to the nice guy that s the issue,for someone who talks about alphas and masculinity so much he s very much the opposite,this is a prime example of human stupidity we need a mutimillion dollar electric barrier due to fish we introduced,why are queens always have the most to say about men but when men give the same treatment you guys get butt hurt
335,5 32 my first time hearing him say nigga,i think that s exactly what it is though,peterson almost all people who watch youtube are males bwwwhahahahaha it s hard to give credit to the rest he says after first hearing that love russell though intelligent respectful and thoughtful interviewer and commentator having said that please watch this they go to excellent places in archetypes i love to see brand getting excited in the discussion,okay okay maybe i m just naive but you re spending millions of dollars to build this electrifying barrier system you re spending tons of money to power the thing why not just build some sort gate system with multiple gates is it because for some mysterious reason you have to to have the canal open i mean i guess you could have a gate system with wire mesh or holes in it enough for water movement and flow and whatnot while keeping the fish from migrating back and forth and multiple gates would negate chances of the carp from getting past into the lake or alongside a barge,wait not letting a woman have male friends is alpha sounds like little d insecure energy my wife s best friend is a male sure he is gay but even if he wasn t i d be cool with it i know what i got i know what i deliver if i had to give up my female friends i d feel pretty sad and i would refuse to do so
336,paul joseph watson content is solid and to the point my man,skate3450 that s another perspective to look at it i guess make sense to me,the masculinity in women also needs to be developed,guys i got this let me snipe the carp as they jump out of the water,easy money swim in it
337,i eat good quality meat,exactly it makes sense to me instincts make sense to me not complicated if you being fake an suck in up to her instincts don t like that so do you and don t give a fuck cuz that what we really want to do,these conversations should be at the forefront,what makes anyone think that terrorists domestic or otherwise haven t already caught and transferred carp into the great lakes,24 38 i was super vibin and loving the vid until this moment noah sarahs in the comments rise up
338,you re built like a freaking twig lmao stop flexing your bones,some guys couldn t handle a woman s truth thats why they lie i like your dad bod what she means you need to lose weight why do you think she puts her husband on a diet,pretty much just here for the comments,why does he have a stupid net sees flying angry fish ohh,you and your bisexual lighting
339,are you gunna get in a call with brandon kinda have to back your words bother we wanna hear the talk,actually not true bro females are smart and they know by keeping a guy overweight they re limiting his options with other woman it s like a guy who has an average looking gf but with makeup she becomes way more attractive a guy might try prohibit makeup as much as possible to limit her attractiveness options a girl keeping a guy overweight simply knows he s better looking and more desirable by woman when he s in shape,having problems commenting and connecting but you know why the real reason shhhhhh,life finds a way be it a tyranasaurus or goldfish malcolm tought us well they are probably testing the fence for weaknesses clever,submit to yooouuu
340,i respect you voicing this truth but i can t be a fan if you fuck with tate he s a trust fund child had everything handed to him and made it look like he came up like drake basically his daddy was a grandmaster chess champion in england and gave his mother alot of money for both the brothers to be rich before they graduated,ngl i ain t know what 304 was either i had to search it up,america worships a goddess called columbia shhhhhh,no natural predators hmmmm do i count,tweedle dee and tweedle dum injected with polo ralph lauren cologne and nissan gtr break fluid
341,lol who cares about how he came up the ideas are the point his life story is irrelevant we shouldn t like him because his father was a g and his mother took care of her kids lol so he comes from intelligent and competent blood that s a good thing,they love toxix guys because they re toxic its simple a half decent women isnt going to want to chase another grown man around,look at virginia shhhhhh,0 04 weeee,i hate to be the one to bring this up but you are wrong you are ssoooooo wrong tom and jerry are hanna barbara not warner bros
342,sneako you are based and i like you just try not to say the lord s name in vain plz,nahhhh lmao i can tell u that kind nice girls love this shit too they all do i ve been that guy for that girl it isss what it isssss,goddess liberty coin 1776 around the time the illiumanti was formed,nurture uh uh finds a way,who should pay for the date whoever the fuck can jesus xd we are all too poor to still be having this conversation are y all okay
343,no hate but i swear i head sneako say the n word,this here not all women are toxic some won t even give toxicity the time or the day some woman already know what they want but thats the thing only some there s not many,father god didn t put females over mailed the mail has the authority and that settles that remember eve came from adams rib and they keep on disrespecting jesus christ i promise you i will expose even more,what happens when you start messing about with nature,new guys dropped
344,hey sneako what do you use as app to record like this i want to start too,saw this chick that said she wants a man that gives her the world i did that she broke up w me now im older nd look better guess who wants me now,cbs columbia broadcast system columbia house columbia records columbia records columbia studios it s america secret columbia goddess the district of columbia is in washington dc,as a resident of michigan and a lover of lake erie please close that canal,no guy friends that man has been cheated on before
345,these speed rip offs be getting outta hand,that s backwards asf i m super blessed to learn this because this would be confusing if i didn t,thank you russell you have elevated the discourse that i had otherwise found wearying of late,life uh finds a way,all of these dudes seem to just care about looking less insecure to get stuff instead of actually becoming more secure its pathetic they think having a girlfriend will solve their problems
346,missed you broski don t let em stop this message this shit needs to be heard,i texted a girl yall women are so backwards and her reply was i know we are it s amazingly sad tbh but that is their life not mine,feminazi is very wrong and wicked and evil,imagine the electrical bill every day of every year of every decade,17 50 im empathetic and caring but like in a hot and sexy villainous kinda way like oooh is probably my favorite line of yours lmao
347,i just started seeing your content for like a week now and omg so much has happened it s crazy i feel like i woken up to what s rely happening this it crazy,well at least she admitted it that s actually shocking because most wont admit to it they would rather live a lie but like you said it s their lives,the goddess coin1776 around the time the illuminate was formed,i see birds behind why ain t they effected,you comedy is top notch ngl
348,sneako bro watching this arc of your like is really entertaining lol when in your thirties i m going to be fun watching you cringe at your past self which is who you are today hahahaha,my ex lied about hella shit i called her out broke up with her didnt talk to her for 2 days then she blew up my phone apologizing about everything and told me all the shit she was lying about thinking i would take her back lmao,you have cbs columbia house columbia records columbia studios columbia college the district of columbia is in washington dc,this will fail because humans always do thank the moron that brought those fish over just like the damn zebra muscles at least they were accidental,lol funnily enough due to my own experiences and upbringing i would honestly say that with my ex that i didn t care as much as she did as a self defense mechanism and engrained machismo and god was that terrible for our relationship eventually definitely was a huge factor in us splitting up this lean of mine towards indifference rather than caring exacerbated her own insecurities haha this is terrible advice
349,get that milli bruh fucking love the content,never get in a relationship just have a rotation and stay out the way,look at virginia,put that barge traffic on rail not trucks,the issue i ve found is that when i pay for my part a majority of the men i date feel emasculated which i guess is better to learn early however when i let them pay they feel entitled to my body it s like i m damned if i do damned if i don t
350,they want you cancelled but without you or andrew tate those people don t get views let s be honest the only reason the get views is cuz they talk about you guys keep the hood job sneako,dropped some more fyeeee,columbia goddess america secret,focus on the uk love,you can t win out here
351,extremely common sneako dub,go to the gym and become toxic remember guys be the one she cheats with not the one she cheats on,the reason why is because of the columbia goddess it s hidden and people don t understand the statute of liberty at all and they want women running the show but god jesus christ didn t put women in charged,what a waste of money what about the ships that takes in water into their balast tanks what if they take the water in the forbidden side and then dumbs it on the side they dont want them it common knowledge that fish and other living stuff gets sucked into the tanks and have been a thing that have put new spiecies new places,save yourself a step here if they can t get to the place where they feel entitled to your body they feel emasculated picking up the check is just an excuse
352,sneako you should get sam hyde on,francois nel this satanic doctrine started with the feminist sexual liberation movement the tyrones and chads took advantage of that and now if your 23 you d be surprised if you found a women with under 6 bodies adapt or die,0 20 iden ity poglitics,a little butter garlic,you quoted matthew hussey s point out of context in bad faith his point was to challenge men always having to pay absurdifying the claim you obviously didn t watch the video you did the same with vaush buddy
353,theres no way sneako is actually watching paul wattson,francois nel they don t understand we as men allowed this to happen because tyrone and chad don t hold this women accountable and dismiss them if they were trying to cheat on their man it made their behavior acceptable tyrone and chad on that me first mentality selfishness is one of the roots of all of this,you two supremely alpha males should have whipped your willies out and see who has the biggest,it s really to bad there so boney because they could be a good food source,i know i saw him in the thumbnail and was like he definitely doesn t deserve to be in this video
354,bro there gonna cry keep going common sneako w,truth they all cheat,i have to disagree with jordan here on the truism why else did the terms masculinity and femininity form if they were not cultural truisms throughout the ages the difference is significant enough to yield mass acceptance through all cycles of society through peace and war perhaps i m guilty of not seeing the additions context within his discussion,why dont they add a lock so they can close it while no barges pass through in addition to the electric barrier,great video man subbed right on in there
355,anyone know who the soy milk guy he reacted to is,naphtali de wit no sir i don t do relationships only female friends with benefits,russell is one of a very small number of liberals having an honest conversation with all types of people good for him wish there were more like him good intentions and a sincere effort to navigate the shit show were all dealing with,i think its very hard to close off a flowing river even some sort of net would be very disruptiv especially as it would have to be very fine as only the small fish present problem,i m so glad to see my favorite mustache man growing and being seen more
356,euuuughhh speak your truth,preludef20bking other side of the fence,jordan peterson is a hack and a snake oil salesman i don t understand why anyone gives him a platform,life finds a way,one thing that will never fail to be funny to me is all the incels alpha males that flock to these videos to tell women like me what our dating preferences are imagine being that clueless word of advice no one knows what women want better than other women and every woman is different instead of listening to bad misogynistic takes why don t you talk to the women you re close to and get to genuinely know them on a deep and personal level learn what they re looking for in a partner and if you re compatible with their wants and needs shoot your shot
357,well i think this is happening because easier times of living not just here in the united states but all the wealthier economies like korea for example,been there done that it s bull you think like that until you re on the other side of the fence,this is fucking hilarious,but what s stopping a bad actor from catching a carp himself driving to the great lakes and then dropping the fish into the lakes,if dating a woman is so bad why dont they just date men
358,imagine being his neighbor,this mantality is bad,if you are having trouble with a positive image of your maleness have your estrogen levels checked before you dismiss this comment consider the following 1 there are so many foods that are loaded with estrogen such as soy products flax seed many things that fatten animals etc 2 men are getting more sensitive but not through empathy through too much accumulated estrogen 3 women are also estrogen dominant and it s playing havoc with their cycle plus they are stuck viewing life through their feelings it s more difficult to view things rationally when hormones are flooding their brain 4 this alone is weakening our natural mechanisms for learning evolutionary biologists are studying the phenomenon,so we re told we re over fishing and here are rivers bursting with fish so much so we re electrifying them to death all this ecological stuff is just manipulation of the many by the few,because they re not attracted to them i m assuming
359,sep 8 word of the day mawkish mawkish means exaggeratedly or childishly emotional and is often used to describe works of art music or literature that a critic finds cloying from merriam webster,mfs can t believe this shit works and if it does it s with 8 s none of y all pulling 9 10s so what are we talking about,80 of youtube audiences are male where is he pulling that statistic from his own youtube studio i don t think that s a fair comment youtube isn t male dominated as a whole xd men were just going to his channel more because it interested them more xd,what if someone just catches a few stores them and then drives to the great lakes and just releases them d i mean,there should be a minimum intelligence requirement to be able to use the internet we shouldn t just be able to say stupid shit like this and project it to the world like some universally acknowledged truth willy nilly
360,i m gonna make a video on sneako this weekend but not a bad one i m just really proud of this man,damn this is gonna fuck up the world even more it s all a cycle it s tyrone and chad s fault too,2 people from the two sides of politics that are the most down to earth and i most respect this is amazing,carp ocalypse,your continued dedication to bomberman hero music the greatest ost of all time is noted and appreciated
361,pez neck bro,why do you think these women love future,jordan peterson talks masculinity with a man wearing a man bun lol love ya russ,this is soo stupid and pointless carps are actually a great source of food for humans and animals they also taste great too america is just too privileged and thinks bottom feeder fishes are nasty whereas the rest of the world carp is delicious food,can t believe i used to watch these guys videos this is fucked up
362,god damn relax hoes,not all of us do,if you have any questions about the 1610 king james bible from beginning to end i m here,hey america use this idea with your border fencing it s steel,my advice to all the little blue pill beta cucks here if you want t find out aboutsolipsism and more so the broad theme female nature check out strong succesful male channel no made up stories top proof of the modern narcciscist women out there when you kind of open youreyes start looking around you and the holy angel pr tric most women play cute looking but dangerous that is their secret weapon patriarchy the girls that knew how to play those dudes back then had it good already a feminine good looking women with low no morals is a true femme fatale amber heard almost got away with the whole lying she did lie under oath will she be prosecuted im afraid not so guys noah where is that patriarchy and mysogny youre all alkiing about
363,that dude has a mustache like a 70 s porn star,lol facts bro,the holy bibles have an agenda great men see the male dominated fallacy not god intended man intended egads lol xo,that electric grid in the water is terrifying and i m sure effective i say terrifying because i had a friend years ago killed by being electrocuted in water faulty wiring on the boat dock he dropped something in the water went in to get it horrible way to go i wasn t there but i still get emotional thinking about that whole mess,inane ramblings
364,calm down weezy u gotta get with the program stay low for a sec the feds watching ya dawg you been talkin too much,ayo someone send dr dre the link to this channel,high five with the slush huh sound in a blow up kudos,i m an electrician all my bosses and most of my friends are gone i ve seen many men die this is 6 volts your buddy was killed with as low as 120 volts or 208 240 volts maybe as high as 277 480 volts all are lethal we try really hard to make sure what happened to your friend doesn t happen but it s a matter of budget and will the owners or operators don t usually understand the risks become complacent fail to test and maintain and people die or get severely burnt or disfigured 50 000 electrical fires in the us each year 135 a day not including electrocutions,hey guys do you want to know about female nature we asked a man homie touch grass
365,all of this guys information is outdated dairy gives you acne and red meat makes ur dick soft don t believe this shit,7 34 had me dead when he said 304,i couldn t follow the entire video here is general kindergarten men want betty crocker by day naughty lover by nite women want to believe they are heard validated with intuition if a decent woman safe and also dream of a naughty lover,rest in peace,ooof you actually think people should be proud to be obese aka death by food most of my family is fat i literally starved myself so i would never be fat if your fat loose weight if your fluffy then meh if your anorexic get some fat thats how people should look at it
366,you been my main source of entertainment recently keep going brother god be with you,steph been thinking about this red pill stuff and it s like damn you right but at the same time i feel like a lot of people are being led into a low spirit the whole idea of pump and dump sleeping with a random girl who is probably an adulteress i don t think it makes sense i think it s best to promote the idea of being with a woman who acc adds some form of value only instead of this pump and dump because some of these young boys like me are out here wanting to sleep with any random girl and eventually this random girl could ruin they life with this pump and dump,i come to listen to peterson talk about politics and masculinity i leave wondering where i can get his book on parenting,not an electrical grid,because starving yourself is totally more healty
367,we are not making it out the culture of conspiratorial thinking bred by anti intellectualism,right because people are aware of the game at a young age the cycle will keep going on some of us actually just want a simple genuine relationship and nothing toxic but since others keep doing all this and making ppl feel like this the good will be succumbed by the bad day by day,why does he makes up statistics everywhere and generalizes stuff its 56 male on youtube so no it s not generally true in case of youtube,sorry for your loss,not all body types are the same and being healthy doesn t necessarily mean everybody will have the same body shape you literally starved yourself do you think that s healthier do you really think that s healthier than being a little overweight
368,they re npcs,so i m assuming you want a ltr in that case you can spin some plates and from there on decide which is the best girl for your commitment promote that plate to ltr drop the other plates common signs of not ltr material bipolar disorder borderline personality disorder narcissistic personality disorder 304 tendencies a lot of male friends etc remember a girl isn t your priority your purpose is far more important note do not catch oneitis oneitis can easily happen with a ltr you re the prize always have an abundance mindset how you handle the ltr is on you utilize the red pill don t and you will be sucked back in the matrix oneitis when a guy has fallen in love with a woman in the same way a boy loves his mother he obsesses about her but she does not reciprocate plate woman with whom you are in a non exclusive sexual relationship with spinning plates is the act of having multiple plates simultaneously ltr long term relationship,i ve grown so tired of the hard line i m right and you re wrong types that seem to inhabit every area of my life real world online etc i am so thankful for those who truly wish to have discussions in an attempt to understand views which oppose their own what a breath of fresh air this was,i m sorry about your friend i hope that in time you can heal,i like that you are outdoors sorry i don t have anything more insightful but i like that good vid
369,men becoming feminine is a good thing,you are a very wise young man and your comment is a breath of fresh air you know the truth,two awesome humans having a meaningful conversation lovely on the ears,feels like he just finished a 5k and is out of breath from it if you know what i mean,madonna whore complex is big in this one
370,lmfao how it s definitely not good,steph has mentioned that multiple times that the women should add some sort of value to your life especially if you putting your time and especially money into her he also mentions nothing wrong with dating but you need to be aware and don t be a fool,russell brand continues to pleasantly surprise and impress me with his takes on different topics even though i think i basically know his stance on issues i m constantly amazed at how difficult it is to paint him as a partisan he masterfully keeps the daggers from being thrown about very respectful indeed much appreciated sir,very complicated why not just put a net,if you ask for my time you should pay if i ask for your time i should pay we are not friends we want to date i think it s normal more times than often men are asking women for their time thus yes pay for the darn date she doesn t have to go on the date she s giving you time the roles can be reversed just say you want to be the lady and be taken out simple
371,aint no way,22 years old and he knows all the facts salute to you bro,my 2 favorite persons on yt,why don t people overfish the carp,hey ma get the camera it s a pussy version of ned flanders
372,15 15 this clip is life changing,till she buhhhh,uni y is probably my name fav british word,solving a human created ecological disaster with a human created ecological solution what could go wrong,i don t care feminist from tiktok are even much weirder and in real live feminist are from upper middle class at minimal case of eastern europe and also psychopaths lyers and manipulators often also xenophobic i know many cases like that i don t belive you at all
373,ngl the aba diss hurt my soul,damn this depressing af haha,it doesn t help that we have these psychotic karen types around spreading their misery usually they have started themselves so much to day thin they are brainwashed and psychotic or the botox gets into their brain these man hating botulism zombies are as shameless as they are malicious they have a narcissistic delusion that all men are stupid and they are cleverer and smarter than everyone and anyone who breaks this illusion gets their full wrath for showing they are actually quite thick and nasty without their fantasy world protection,what happens during a power outage,sarah i think you should reconsider
374,sneako u have become a sheep to the elite this is what they want they want you arguing and complaining its all a political game and we are all losing,i m young asf the world is devastating but ima pave a light path for me,this is that interview i ve been waiting for,easy way to get dinner just take a boat out and let the fish jump onto your fish fry,tbh most women are rather reasonable with the whole paying for a date thing from what i ve experienced and even discussed with women
375,sneako you are feminine we forgetting you watched your girl sleep with another man infront of your eyes,it is bro but at least we got the knowledge to navigate thru this shit,depends what you define as masculine too for instance anger issues and wanting to pick fights with every guy over the smallest things is that masculine or is that being a meathead being overly sexual and pervy to the point of scaring a woman is that masculinity there are some very positive sides to masculinity that help push along society but part of that involves self control too this is where i think feminists and trads clash they cant agree on the definition,humans are great at overfishing why not just overfish the carp into oblivion,your edits are funny af
376,u took your wife fucking last name you forking salop haaaaaa i bet she s wearing the bath tower on her waist,aye i feel you bruh but you just learning the truth about female nature consider it a blessing because a lot of men out here won t know this game,start with chopping off all manbuns,great idea but whats going to stop some prick from putting them in a cooler and taking them around the said barriers i understand that has to be a self conscious and common sense decision not to do that but people are people and ill leave it at that,these people are genuinely terrifying thanks for talking abt this another banger
377,bruh sneako bout to school shoot some people,mindset 100,i use to be a bun man not anymore get rid of the buns,theoretically if you introduce the carp s natural predator would that not solve the problem what kind of ecological consequence would happen if you were to do that,in a hilarious twist of irony i think the specific kind of self hatred i possess kept me from being pulled into the incel worldview i check every demographic box on their target audience but every time i encounter their content i just sort of thought oh so that s why no women want me damn their smart good for them honestly and then went on with my life like normal
378,13 43 mindset is big as well a can do attitude goes a long way,listening to this knowledge in my baccyard with the cool breeze blowing and the birds chirping after a good workout and protein dinner feels real good fellas good shit steph,masculinity is in short supply said the person with a hair bun jeez we got a lot of work to do,this would probably do even more demage d now the predetor kills all the carps but will probably not stop there so the cycle continous and you have to introduce the predetors predetor into that system and so on while completly destroying everything d,with the whole who pays for the date argument i think that you should either split the bill or whoever asked the other on the date they should pay
379,lets go,u must ve got a new pack of tank tops cuz that s all u been rockin lately g definitely the wave for the summer,i laughed on the toilet aloud,do they tatse good,hmm the empath style no i rather not but that s just my 2 cents
380,there s so many npc s,they sayings are always oxymorons,respect on this video,they do in europe carp is a protected species because of overfishing,there is much more to it than just choosing empath or asshole
381,bro not gonna lie this is giving off the boy vibes,i want someone to call me every hour bring me flowers keep it up y all keep doing that bogus ass shit you gonna find yourself mad sad cause bro say this shit over and over and y all don t listen,men mostly watch youtube really,why can t you net them like they do in the ocean once or twice a week for a couple of months sure you ll catch other species but they can be sorted if there s a will there s always a way at least try,does this mean noah is a simp according to redpillers
382,bruh why is this guy correlating rape with islam how stupid can you be when an atheist does it or a christian does it then he s just a rapist soyboy,patrice o neal would be proud,jordan and russell are two valuable men,since the economics of shutting down the canal seem unalterable how about a large crane boat lift on rails to lift a boat over a dam in the canal instead of this electric nightmare is there flow in the canal possibly it would be safer and use less power to pump water around a dam a pump could have screens to keep fish out and any that did get through would get chopped into sea gull food,there s like a massive issue in the biology community i think that unfortunately helps play into this way of thinking animal behaviorists often liken how animals choose mates to how humans go about dating and they try way too hard to explain away all human dating behaviors as biologically inherent while some of them certainly are like dressing nicely for a date there s a lot that aren t and are just a product of how the society we ve built is structured those can t really be explained with biology but a lot of biologists do their hardest to try so when biologists are out here saying oh women will go after men who are older and have more money because they need a male to provide for them because biology redpill guys will absolutely eat that up it s a viewpoint that is really centered around how men feel in a patriarchal society and fails to capture any nuance in human dating or the reality of human lifestyles men aren t the only ones who put on a show for a potential partner s attention women do that too men aren t the only providers to a family women do that too it s just annoying how even biologists subscribe to this idea that a patriarchy exists for a reason and actively push for massively bioessentialist views on human behavior people might argue against this and say well something being biologically based doesn t necessarily mean it s okay and it s just a simple fact and yeah but think about what you are arguing for there that women are biologically just submissive and meek and peaceful and men are dominant and loud and violent and that s the truth that helps nobody and is transphobic and misogynistic but because it s biology people take it as fact and use as an excuse for shitty men s behavior and it just gives incels alpha male types more ammunition
383,wasnt that soy video already debunked many times years ago i thought sneako said he was informed,signed up for the free ebook can t wait to read it been doing a lot of reading as of late,you tube audience mostly men thats a suprise to me all my female friends watch it,yay and we get to pay for people s stupidity it even when i just buy food,why are they all black
384,sneako has held the torch beautifully,these women are smart,1 27 i m honestly happy to be part of the 35 hope the number will increase even more,time to bring a cooler full of carp and dump it into the great lakes thus thwarting millions of dollars of infrastructure,why do you think that s a relevant pattern
385,man i missed this mofo welcome back sneako,they re not as smart as they come across a woman s emotions always get the best of her,digging the gracie jiu jitsu hoodie,dam up everything the great lakes cannot take this,women in comment section getting offended this guys are just spitting facts
386,its always the frail or fat guys that complain,today steph every bitch is a 304 however we just gotta ask what s is the p e ratio or what is your cut off number,i just love the communication dance happening here,wow that s really fascinating thank you us army corps of engineers,a man paying for a date is out of a few bucks a woman having sex with a man exposes herself to unwanted pregnancy which men bail on all the time so the comparison is not weighted the same at all yet many men think if they re expected to pay that they re entitled to sex immediately i still expect any man i entertain to pay but it s not a guarantee for sex i also believe in meeting their needs if it s not too much according to my own standards both parties have the right to have certain standards there s no way i ll ever date a man who won t pay in the beginning cuz that s how i feel the interest
387,i found yo channel through brandon buckingham now you wanna say hes a rapist,shoutout to stephiscold for droppin that real cold book you a real one fam,no such thing as masculine or feminine behavior still sexist good try though,the chicago ship canal has no natural right to exist it should be filled in,can we please stop calling them men they are boys toddlers at best
388,shneako the no,man stephiscold your right on point with this topic bro can t get logic from someone that s act s on their emotions i take there word for a grain of salt even the one s that say i wouldn t do that to you,no such thing as masculine or feminine behavior still sexist good try though,a very american solution to a very american problem,man i m learning so much about myself as a woman from these videos whoever knew
389,who s the guy he reacted to,7 38,114 simon peter said to them make mary leave us for females don t deserve life jesus said look i will guide her to make her male so that she too may become a living spirit resembling you males for every female who makes herself male will enter the kingdom of heaven,this would be a shocking discovery for the carp,submission you gotta accept my terms otherwise theres the door ok i heard that from parents damn didnt know this isnt a equal balance relationship where both sides are respected and heard but more to that of im above you you should listen to me kinda relationship women cannot get enough of te male attention women ehove been having unrequested unwanted male attention sice literall childhood uh yeaaaah no women don t appreciate the journey that it takes to get to a point meanwhile so i just paid for dinner on our very first date when do we fuk
390,preach that shiitttttt,this man be saying the opposite to every girl on social media and i love it,nobody is denouncing masculinity it s hypermasculinity that s the problem i suppose there will always be those who can t tell the difference on both sides of this issue,the state of illinois has much bigger problems than this already,the cringe oh the cringe so painful yet so good
391,move over to rumble and let s take cfvi,ranen narsey they be lying perception is everything to them,it is absolutely insane that in order to explain why masculinity should be encouraged and developed in men peterson has to couch it in terms of what s good for women it s as if brand sees no value in men so he can t fathom why it s worth helping them of course coming from a feminine man like himself perhaps i shouldn t be surprised,they put toxins in the water for when they were down for maintenance their willingness to do this is telling and they haven t learned a thing from all their meddling,wow the amount of incels in the comments amaze me noah please block them or something and you really gotta start watching positive stuff i m saying this for you
392,sneakooo i miss u bro,numbers don t lie women do,main thing i get from your talks with jordan peterson is that you really enjoy discussions with jordan peterson and i feel from the videos that the feeling is mutual,i refuse to believe that one could destroy so much by throwing a couple of fish into the lake and yet not a single troll did it,i don t think you know what incel means
393,bruh i m allergic to milk what should i use as a substitute,women love when men don t care for them invest in yourself kings,and this ladies and gentlemen is what a healthy conversation looks like if most modern conversation looks like a bar fight this was competition level martial arts,they did there were tests done on the water and while they found no visual indications of any carp they found carp dna,stay oozing empathy my guy
394,actually noah has more views on other vides,and in cryptos my g xd,the movie carrie,thats why the energyprices are so god damn high,your moustache is shaped like little leafs and it makes me happy your videos are really nice too thanks noah
395,he came back i miss you dude,they re cold lol if the guy isn t cooperative she ll lie to another guy to get to close to the guy she does want lmao it s not about just dick neither guys it s the dick they actually want and desire,the devouring mother needs to learn to be like mother bird you feed them you raise them but always push them to spread their own wings,we need to change the way we think animal migration has been just as prevalent of earth as human migration if accidents occur and a species is established if we can use that situation to our advantage the money can be used to do conservation elsewhere those carp can now provide a steady sustainable resource the profits of which can be used to fix other issues safeguard similar issues occurring again and protect other areas species and habitats elsewhere that might be at risk or under threat,cool guys being dudes
396,soy milk taste nasty supposedly healthy i mean might off been coconut milk but still don t taste as good as cow milk well jersey milk don t rate american uk milk so much,i genuinely appreciate stephiscold,russell i can t tell you how much watching your videos assist me in managing my own thoughts you are bringing almost every imaginable topic to the table your last video with jordan really helped me in an area i was struggling with it was emotionally disturbing to me in a very positive manner how to be moral and also not cast it aside in my employment when jordan mentioned how much more reward do you need than knowing someone has benefited from something you shared that was the goal to help correct you try but you don t know and than you found it helped someone profoundly that would be surprising and very humbling very i don t go to church often and i have even found myself questioning religion however i can not imagine jesus as he has been described not being his most pleased by a person simply helping someone else and genuinely caring that is simple but it s most true thank you for caring and providing so much thought provoking commentary what a person you have become another trait that would be admired by a kind and loving higher being selfless i am attempting to improve thanks for the content to help in this i want you to know that i am truly grateful,0 03 fish go burr,isn t this guy supposed to be a socialist but is making vids based on sponsers even if they offer nothing insightful
397,man it runs so deep,oh another thing the more she don t lie about her having a husband or something she telling you she want to be your pornstar privately a dark secret she won t even tell herself that s a woman trump card lol,both these guys as smart as i d like to be but what a journey to get there i m to lazy deep thought common sense and decency for all that want honest wise opinions love listening to both thanks guys,imagine a power outage and the fish getting through,socialism is when no sponsors on youtube video
398,bro i m woke but i like soy milk smh but specifics one,edible _ horse out there,machismo is one of the manifestatios of meritocracy machismo is the easiest possibility for any boy and man to feel superior meritocracy leads everyone to try to feel superior,excellent for cat food why not catch them,_ you object to society yet also _ _partake_ _ in society _ _curious _ _ i am very smart _ no no you really aren t
399,well i have a few people i need to tell about soy,edible _ horse and you may that old yesssssss energy is that real everyone has someone out that just does for them and it s indescribable,i like jordan peterson he makes so much sense and i just happen to like things that make sense the world should listen to this man,why not harvest this carp school of fish and export them to china,best mustache in the game
400,soy doesn t affect testosterone levels,edible _ horse a woman can go up to 40 something yrs old and run into a guy who just does it for her her body uncontrollably around him and that s him,in one the shrek movies the fairy godmother is the devouring mother can t remember which one but it was fiona s mother and the dragon before that,great video but it get me thinking if only certain transportation can pass i think there could be other less dangerous and expensive ways to do this like a layer of water jets pushing to one direction gates like panama canal huge fish nets paddle thingies pushing water homeless people slapping back the carps etc,i just wanna say that i really appreciate your videos there are very few men out there who are up to the task of bringing up the patriarchy the red pill and misogyny especially in a way that not only explains it but also provides a helpful male view it s definitely not an easy task but it s legit so needed right now props to you
401,sneako the goato,i ve always wondered what a 304 is but i can use mfn context clues so i kinda knew when he said put it in ya calculator and turn it upside down i died,love russell b but talking masculinity while wearing a man bun seems a bit ironic nothing masculine about the man bun,i d gladly vote for a levy to employ homeless people slapping back the carps,i also thought during your ad read amazon bought a forest i was doing dishes my brain wasn t at 100
402,ha imagine having the money to afford fast food,chicks put it in my pager back then,who was in charge of the white balance in the edit on this video hahaha,lmaoooooo homeless people slapping back the carp,when he said some women can t give up the melatension i thought he meant melatonin but then realized he meant male attention
403,you do look like you going insane my boi tho,hahaha just got it,sound is fucked,now that we know some idiot will release carp into great lakes for fun,lol idk why it isn t obvious that the person that invites the other out to eat needs to pay and if you can t do that you have to specifically state that from now on ya need to split bills
404,that guy is a certified g,i m dead i can imagine dude turning the calculator upside down an bring oohhhhhhhhh,and most women are attracted to man visually as a man is to a women,no one notice the bird going in and out of the water as it was being shocked,ok it s official bomberman music is bisexual
405,abundance of instant gratification is making men become lazy abundance of instant gratification is making women become entitled we are both at fault stop with the woman hating shit,i thought it had something to do with a phone like how each number got letters lmao,women raising boys is enough damage to ruin those boys for their life boys need a man in their life,that looks like an awful lot of ancillary substation equipment for a lousy 6 volts per inch of material,it slaps so hard always nice to hear in the wild
406,get on rumble and linked in brother let s keep this movement going they re gonna take you out soon,king staunch search it up,russell you remind me of my dog i love to hate him good work,this is what we need to do to the rio grande,you ve outdone yourself noah
407,5 32,i laughed when i found out too,what to do with over protective parents it seems there s no escape from that you re weak enough and too vulnerable to fight that and they have a system of 100 or zero support to keep you in chain,i hope no fish adapt and become immune to this device,has anyone seen my vagina bruh we aren t legitimately going to submit you re not suppoused to be serious and the look of every guy who says this to boot
408,many chemicals and pestizides cause breast cancer in women and lower testosteron in men,lol i still don t get it yet help a brother out,i used to respect jordan immensely but he really sunk to a low level when he told people to just get the jab,is this not part of the great loop boating path are there not pleasure boats needing to use that canal or do they have another path,i don t agree that men should always pay at all but pay for a date or there is no date is different than consent to sex or i will force it on you like how can those things even be compared
409,ngl u should definitely come to greece again it was hella fun the first time,there s this one girl on my ig in her stories keep posting memes about wanting a man who only wants her now that i m red pilled i automatically know that a guy digging her guts out and he s an alpha with a rotation of women if i was still blue pilled i would been white knighting for her,4 34 russell super excited jordan is like let s calm down for a second,all because of a fish,the best part about the restore dislikes plugin is that i can easily find out that 317 redpill guys watched this video and smashed their impotent fists against their desks knocking over their jordan peterson busts and causing their barstool hats to fly off their heads before mashing the dislike button
410,my boi you speak half truths and call yourself a prophet you make good points sometimes nd others for entertainment i get ur methods are successful so you think you can t be checked every dog has his day i don t think ur a terrible person i can only speak on what i ve seen this isn t hate you can learn from anyone at any time even from someone you dont like or agree with no one has all the answers peace and prosperity to u sneako,always remember that brotha,could not agree more important conversation here,i kinda wish it killed the fish,wow so funny
411,this is what growing up on youtube does to our younger generations,this seems like a dig at this movement love this comment,jordan s followers are mostly men because they are looking for leadership and validity he has changed so many men s lives for the better he s a treasure,just have a huge cookout on the shores mmm,perhaps the sun s uv rays will disinfect these lumps of misogyny toe jam once noah has finished dragging them out into daylight
412,it s funny bc sneako tate and the manosphere is just like feminism for men so i guess meninism y all are cringe af,fams i don t even dig when i m in the sack i just sit here and act like she needs to put the heat on or i m leaving,stop hiding the link to the joel greenberg child sex trafficking indictment i m sure your viewers want to learn about current elected republican officials who are charged with child sex trafficking so stop deleting my posting of the link that tells them how to see it are you afraid of informing your low intelligence viewers,why not just reintroduce the carps natural enemy over here,whomever asked to go out is typically the one that should pay if i ask someone out i would pay for the date if i get asked out the person that asked me should pay splitting is fine as long as you have communicated this when making the plans so nobody is unprepared without money honestly it shouldn t be that hard or that big of a deal
413,better than being a male feminist tbh,rihanna would always choose chris brown over any guy whenever he ready idk if he knows that or not but coming across the page he would lol the more abrupt the departure is the more she will do anything for you if you let her in again,is anyone else tired of elected officials getting charged with child sex trafficking,i couldve saved the army millions of dollars by throwing a few m80 s in the lake,and who mostly does the asking men usually women are mostly passive daters you look like an attractive woman ill assume youve been asked out plenty and dont really have to ask out dudes if you want to but that is not mens reality if i dont approach or ask out women i will remain lonely even if im good looking plus not to mention that men who are socially dominant and lead and plan dates are seen as more attractive so i could say lets split or ask the woman where she wants to go but that wont make me seem attractive it should be that whoever asks out but it will still fall on men regardless
414,right and theyre a lot worse and spread a lot more hate around,she recently broke up with a billionaire as well,the weird lighting makes this feel like a rerun,remember disney s an american tail about russian mice moving to ny city and overcoming all the adversaries to make a fresh start in the new world they could do a fish story about european carp making it through this barrier and beating the bigoted system that kept them out of the promised lakes,i actually do have a very reasonable answer to the who pays for the date question _whoever invites the other person s on the date is the one that pays_ so if you ask someone s out on a date it s understood that you re paying for the date and vise versa that way it stays pretty even throughout the relationship and eventually paying for the date will be seen as a romantic gesture it ll also still allow you your partner s to go on dates even if one of you is short on cash that month
415,you were supposed to carry tates light not become what everyone expects of you why are you so mean lately criticizing others constantly like the first 1 minute of this video is insane like are you on something why do you hate their behavior sooo much lmao,joshua travis also lebron james she got a whole crush on him,you guys talk to much focusing on trivial topics is a waist men want to right what s wrong,we need this at the border,wait hold on i just realised you re the editor for noel s channel lol
416,i just want to know that are people really this dumb and are these people only in america or are they everywhere in the world,all the orbiters needa see this channel,utter click bait wank to sucker empty heads alexa define snake oil,so for how long have they been doing this and what about before they started doing this,thanks noah i was always forgetting to say hey what s up to the cubans now i feel safe doing so
417,lol the fact that sneako of all people has the audacity to call other men feminine when he brings so much bitch energy to any conversation he joins had me rolling and don t you drink from reusable bottles sneako they leak estrogen like crazy i guess that may explain the bitch energy lol if you have to shout and interrupt people to make a barely half assed point at best it reveals your weakness and insecurity not to mention your obscene ego that you have to scream at people to satisfy your ego and cover up your insecurities it reminds me of toy breed dogs in a dog pack they can t do jack shit besides riling up the rest of the pack btw sneako there s no evidence whatsoever that microwaves affect food you need to stop believing all the old wives tales you hear from old ladies at the nursing home oh and get a nutrition and or kinesiology degree before you start trying to coach people on their diets becaause you really don t seem to know what you re talking about,i m gonna comment before watching the video i will see it later but then toxic is not pathetic like always worried about what someone is doing blaming discussin so women like that i thought girls liked a man thats cold who is not crying and blaming everytime,a whole load of rubbish wrapped up in fancy words,karma at its best especially considering the stuff that is coming your way next the worst is yet to come schopenhauer,i m sorry i can t get through the first two minutes of this i have a complaint noah samsen is so attractive i cannot focus i m trying i m trying so hard i dont like facial hair at all usually and i dont even really like guys but i am frothing at the mouth for him someone give me rabies medication i just want to get on with the video but he is so prettyyyyyyy
418,bruh he s living rent free in your head lol you wrote a damn essay kinda seems like your projecting your own insecurities on to him you used the word insecure a lot lol take a break from the internet bud thanks for making me laugh tho,till she bushhhhhh,look at jordan his past and his daughter then ask yourself if this is the guy you want to take advice from crackpot,i m so sick of metric crap just say it in imperial system your in usa,excuse me nipelle
419,the guy is back,there s this girl rn saying that i don t care about her but she still texting me this also applies in high school as well,it s obvious that just like a child everybody should engage in some kind of art form in order to self reflect and fathom out who they are once people connect with themselves and accept who or what they are they soon realise that there is no difference between males and females except from the gender physiology we are born and the super imposed indoctrination which we either choose to accept and work with or reject and reinvent ourselves as something else or something new original and authentic,some poor diver in the navy dive team got zapped for science,ngl the dude who said you guys with a chick and y all in a relationship i though said you guys with a chicken y all in a relationship and for a sec i was like whoah whoa whoah what s going on here
420,_____,keep on not caring about her all we can do is laugh at girls like that,russell has matured a lot in recent years he is willing to learn now instead of jumping in with preconceived ideas or saying what he thinks will be popular this makes the conversation much more interesting as it s less predictable,so you are telling i can end this guys whole careers by capturing some fish in a lake driving 100 km and releasing it in the other,yo once that camel got split in half into an orange i knew this was going to be fire and lo it came to pass that i was fire
421,bro i learn more from this dude then from school,i heard 304 years ago from amg bitch better have my money now i m hearing it again knowledge,from the first second i saw jordan in this interview i knew it was old footage he seems less worried a bit more relaxed here i hope he can recover and get back to this stage again,carp problems years ago i watched two guys with a flat bottom john boat they built an air thruster fan which used a 4hp horizontal petrol engine tiller steering they had crossbows with spools of heavy test braided line they were arrow fishing for carp in two feet of water the air thruster was wakeless no startled carp in coves they shut the engine off and moved by means of a pike in two hours they speared many nasty carp the lake had been a sewage impoundment no fish were suitable for consumption however white stripers were slowly becoming more prevalent summer time temps carp stay in shallows proper game fish go deep,someone calling mathew hussey out wow this guy has a huge platform on dating advice for women and has been called for interviews on pro feminist channels like women of impact this guy is a women s dating coach and he just spreads poison he incentivates women to go after men he incentivates women to keep chasing after being rejected ghosted tells women to pay for the bill and provide seggs i remember him scolding a woman who was dating a guy and found out he was married so she exposed the dude to his wife mathew wanted to bite the woman s head off because the guy being married was not her problem and she was acting out of jealously
422,please spend less time on the internet,a chick that kept dming talkin bout pics im like wtf is dis she keep saying im not trying to i said you going to shoot yo your shot r not she said im not interested you re not my type i said ok n kept grinding same chick on ig yesterday saying somebody put me on im not even worried nor suprised,proper pathways to masculinity this dude is the man,employ large nets and remove them then turn them into fertilizer,who pays for the date whoevers idea it was that s how babe and i do it which leads to sometimes i buy sometimes she buys depending on who has the money to spare at the time
423,then go back to school lord knows he should too,that you can always expect them to lie to you i meant,being emotionally intelligent is not synonymous with being weak,farmers that use electric fences to kerp animals in their property will notice less ants on their lands fire ants are not a native species to the usa beneficial harvester ants are native,redpill is really just working on youself to improve in as many areas as possible its not what 99 of the tiktoks in this video where just hating women
424,true cuddle with gay homies in highschool cause of programming shits whack,ashley jean lmao nah but this shit true been through a lot of this b4,they re the darkness the absence of light controlling your thoughts bringing the night i don t know all your stories or all your reasons why but i know what makes humans afraid to die and again i sigh,a voltage drop of 2 5 volts per inch is going to kill something the size of a human that s a couple hundred volts potential difference from head to toe or hand to hand,true and that isn t a bad thing becoming what you see as a better version of yourself is objectively good but it s mostly the motivations behind it the red pill originated on 4chan where it was used to describe a hierarchy of men where only the ones at the top get to be laid because something something women whoes as it quite evident if you search up red pill content most people that talk about it still believe that and spread that bs it hurts both men and women to see each other in competition if the entire goal is to find someone to make you happy
425,showate showate showate subscribers alewo hiji,maybe u should date a man instead,jesus is god almighty jordan peterson is bible illiterate,the guy explaining reminds me of kenneth from 30 rock,thoughts and prayers to the women of baltimore within a 25 mile radius of that black durag

428,7 24 ohk s9z how i just scroll till there and rn the starbucks thing,they love the challenge,i don t often agree with russell but i do appreciate his willingness to listen and discuss different points of view,hopefuly no terrorists find out to catch a few carps and release them into the great lakes would harm the us industry around the great lakes,lmao that first video so basically us women are for the streets if we don t submit to controlling creeps hell nah women are starting to be respected more brotha we ballin
429,yea things are changing with me but you saw now byee,so woman are naturally inclined to lie to get what they want and it s your job as a man to see through that,thank the maker i m a generationxer google it if you must,human intervention causes harm not for the carps quite the opposite,i wanted to sit here being angry but your humour stopped that thank you
430,talk about the great reset,luck augustin being on semen retention will allow you to become the man that will help her feel more comfortable for her to open up to you more she ll trust you more,i thought for a moment jordan said he was a psychomatrician that would have seriously changed the conversation,tom scott in my backyard,why is masculinity itself synonymous with domination
431,actually cow milk cause increase in estrogen man booobs i never consumed soy product and have gyno these female cow are producing way more milk than they naturally do they are injected with all kinds of estrogen and that estrogen are dissolved in the milk that you drink don t consume milk you don t need to,304 403 yelling hoooooooooooooooe,crystalline distilled truth,welp time to start eating carp,it s not although historically it has been for the wrong reasons
432,is that you in pfp,gentlemen all those if your toxic hmu memes ain t a joke they disguising the truth in comedy,i wanted to hear the entire conversation,thanks ryan great list jazz is the ultimate expression in my opinion,these dudes are gross
433,so much misinformation about soy here there is a huge difference between the estrogen found in food vs the hormone,all good jokes contain true shit j cole,not very masculine to have a hair transplant peterson lol,oh no theres too much food in the river,no u are
434,explain the difference site your sources,not even comedy bruh all them memes and shit sad tbh,the diamond is strong because of the bonds between its atoms jp wants us atomized to be the ultimate individual and the we are nothing but wind,what they need here is some sort of hybrid lock falkirk wheel type structure like a gondola carrying the boat with holes for draining the water and a vacuum function for sucking out fish,i really don t get the who pays for the date debate is this an american thing where i m from we argue in a kinda ritualistic manner about who gets to invite who as soon as the bill arrives eventually somebody concedes but only under the condition that he gets to pay next time not only on dates but in general everything else would seem kinda rude
435,i think you confused high energy with crazy hyper ask your boy tate about this unharnessed hyper energy will lose against true high power energy it s like amps one is a far higher draw than the other or octane most people don t realize octane is the measured ability of a slower burn making for a more powerful stroke with that being said you sir are not high octane you just a little square 9v battery with a bit of a zap not powerful high amperage yet you will be though and i truly hope i live long enough to see it be wise be safe and all the other good stuff,finally someone said it,i m not sure where jordan is getting the statistic that on average on youtube there is 80 20 male female ratio when in its more like 54 46 male female globally and in the us it s pretty close to 50 50,dry lock is the only way power can go out or human failure,i appreciate ur mustache and ur love of celeste
436,0 32 someone make this a beat,ain t this the truth,there s no point in this discussion without first specifically defining masculinity as it relates to the conversation had,power outtage all for naught me thinks,i love your channel because you look just like my baby brother only if he wasn t a raging misogynist
437,this might be one of my favorite recent videos by you sneako i never knew how bad soy was for you im still young 18 but imma definitely cut down on that shit,this man is a father figure for me so blessed stay cold stay knowledgeable,love this conversation,do the fish taste good if so,ummm sensitive men are my absolute favorite please tell me all of you struggles to unlock my heart thanks
438,don t listen to him try and stay away from that stuff as much as possible,always take a woman s claims and stories with a grain of salt they tell the biggest lies the dms loaded like she forgot to take out the trash on garbage day it s consistent the biggest lies are always the most dangerous remember that fam,as a woman i have no appreciation for using woman s sex and sexuality to sell products and services i find it demeaning does not honor women and would like to see this go away,amazing video kyle hill youve done it again wait what its even exactly same title lmao also mind explaining the compound bows behind you d,this is like a how to guide of being a douche
439,lol its not bad you can restabalize your t levels with workouts and eating the right foods afterwards the problem is over consumption thats why theyre sneaking into all our foods that dont even need soy i remember buying little ceasars the other day and i saw soy in their ingredients which pizza does not need,the small lies they tell are dangerous,i don t know why people are so obsessed about gender lately it gets so much hype when the emphasis should really be on character traits like morals and maturity and intelligence work ethic etc imo if a person has lots of good traits they will be a good person regardless of gender age race etc,they re called asian carp they re from asia,this is like a how to guide of being a douche
440,hey sneako love your content truly from heart i have respect for you my beautiful ahh brother nothing would make us happier if you becoming a muslim not like becoming muslims will stop you from stuff you want to say nothing will change but except the fact that you ll be on the right path and you ll be at peace i love you and for the only sole reason that i really want to see you in jannah i wish you become a muslim sooner or later i love you bro mayallah guide you my beautiful handsome badd afffff brother,the bigger the lie the more people will believe in it,interviewing that bloody psycho is not brave or being open minded all it does is convince those strange peterson fan boys of all ages whose balls haven t dropped yet that the creature is a serious intellectual with something relevant to say instead of the psychopathic personality he actually is whose only priority is jordan peterson,i dont understand things like white rhinos we ll hunt to extinction when we re not supposed to then the things we re supposed to hunt no one does you already spent 100 million dollar substation that electrifies the water why not spend another 20 000 hand out fishing poles to the locals,he actually started with no big bro so you want her not even to have her brother in her life because the way you plan to treat her you know any respectable man would whoop your ass noted
441,unfortunately i don t think he would do that since he was verbally mocking muslim people praying etc,you dropped this king,jordan peterson s an intelligent and insightful guy brand though an airhead if ever there was one,i like when people say human intervention causes harm for who for human beings we re irrelevant and like to pretend we can make or break the planet with our kindness or coldness the reality is the planet was here long before us and will be here long after us even if we wiped every large animal out poisoned every river the earth will be fine life is more robust than we imagine the planet is fine the people are f cked george carlin,usually my tip for the alpha bros is to date women they like who also like them it seems they ve never tried it
442,sneako is really racist,solid video something i disagree with is the she cheats with the guy she really wants to be in a relationship with that is not true in many cases they cheat for sexual pleasure out of boredom or just because they know hubby will never find out saying this out of experience,in christianity the church is the bride,how thick are the barriers because couldn t a carp jump them,i actually watched the entire ad because i started to feel nauseous with what he said i m going to go get some ginger ale so i can stomach this entire video so disgusting
443,you are a joke,bro you right one thing about a woman they are never satisfied she can have an alpha digging her out and she ll be like i m tired of being dug out i need me a medium stick lol,no excuse for animal abuse fck human animal superiority speciesism,wonder how much electricity it takes to electrify an entire body of water,i dont like how you mock these guys they need help and love but get rejected by society in so many ways they just feel hopeless including a video like this we should help them instead of mocking or debunking them i too was almost an incel beta and was at a really dark place i now try to help these guys to get out of it and get goals in their life there are way more societal problems going on with the incels and male loneliness bit just mocking and debunking them like this is just a tip of the iceberg
444,you re a woman,i think what he means by that is if a woman could be in a relationship with a player she would be but they won t be in a relationship with one because a player isn t likely to stick around because they re players therefore women use players for sexual pleasure instead,i m a woman and mother and jordan peterson helped me save my life,smart so electrify an underwater fence to prevent famous jumping fish from getting to the other side,they all clearly watched read waaayyyyy too much 50 shades of gray grey
445,so when can we expect the spar with ksi,stephiscold but you know what s colder tell me when you know,this was perfect and amazing,this has been a problem in many areas around the world they need to go to root cause and take care of it at the root and stop spending money on bandages fix the problem do not just keep treating symptoms to a problem use this method to get to a means to an end,i saw the british guy at 1 05 and was surprised i thought he was a dating coach for women and i used to watch his stuff but i guess he went down that path don t remember his name though i also just realized i have the same wolf poster that the tom and jerry guy has in the background ooof for me i guess also i think that when your partner cannot express their emotions it just makes you feel guilty for expressing your emotions anyone who has any emotional maturity knows this i do feel bad for men that they have to be strong all the time when that is impossible you have to have someone to lean on from time to time and that absolutely needs to be normalized like yesterday and oh boy they brought up the whole women can fool around when they re young but not as they age bs these guys actually think that they get bette with age from where it s like they don t listen to women oh that s right they don t also if the person i m out with is more concerned about who is paying for the date than actually getting to know each other then i m not going on a second date i think coming to the realization that heteronormative people are obsessed with this made me 100 for just going dutch a date is about looking for a future partner that you can relate with it s not about bs narratives about who should do what equal is fair and no i don t want someone thinking they can hold that over me and say that i owe them screw that noise
446,i am surprised there was a dude out there who actually celebrated not being able to please his wife i figure that would be seen as anti feminist at the very least,if women really wanted men that other women don t won t there wouldn t be any incels,i loved russell as a comedian loved him when i met him he s involved with the rehab i went to and love him now he s grown up,the fish were stunned,i mean this in the most constructive way possible very little of this was debunking and it s largely taking obtuse interpretations of what the red piller says while giving armchair psychological analysis of the content creator then of course deriding the red pill opinion i m only commenting because you quoted bell hooks on how society enforces patriarchy including feminists while essentially doing the same thing last note while i disagree by and large with much of what the red pill guys say they re note wrong all the time for instance yes you actually do appear better to people if you avoid gossip and can compliment adversaries that s bde but he was wrong in creating a technique out of it that s not how that works and you were wrong in being obtuse as if he was saying a man should avoid giving genuine criticism when it s important to do so he legit said gossip anywho i actually love your content i just think you could benefit from being more persuasive and less preaching to the choir
447,sneako thankyou for changing my life i stopped fapping i swim alot i m getting abs girls like me i have a lot more confidence thankyou for helping me,hence why women love soap operas drama shows movies reality tv drama they love drama,whats the symbol on your jacket,something about tom scott is so annoying,what i took from this is that tom and jerry must be stopped because they banged my partner too
448,i didnt know this after watching this educational video i ran to the kitchen and threw 2 full packs of soymilk through the sink fck being a soyboy low t,legendary as always appreciate the content fells,women don t need a template women express themselves by they re own action and being,i ve always wondered about this excellent video,what happened in these men s childhoods to hate themselves and women so much
449,9 02 nooooo noooo this is the ultimate soyboy,bro changing lives day by day love to see it,flase all things need a template that s why many people are the same our similarities are what being us together and that is an evolutionary biological fact what you say might sound lime some good ole empowerment but its false amd completely against who we are as human beings the very reason we have the longest periods of childhood amongst animals where we have to be raised by our parents is precisely because we need a template to live our lives most people are made up of what they have been raised on even if they go on to join and identify with other tribes but make no mistake it is not the norm for humans to walk alone and hold beliefs and ideologies separate from any group ever existing,soon there ll be electric carp jumping out the water shooting electricity like palpatine,as an enby im too broke to pay for the date 3 and thats because of my gender j
450,i use to respect you but after the beef you re trying to pull with the sidemen im just lost for words,you ain t heard steph is cold,im surprised jordan did not bust out crying like he usually does at random,army carp corp,that was nice
451,unsubscribe and leave bro,cover dr dre s wife divorcing him next bro,russel seems offended or holding anger that s the problem with our liberal friends they can t comprehend that someone has a different opinion from them because they look at themselves as morally superior,border control for fish are they mexican carp barge smugglers,as an anarchist i feel called out by that dine and dash comment i still tip though of course
452,sneako discernment is good keep shining brotha i will do the same soon,she ran up her bag then dipped,read cruel hoax by henry makow phd,i worked at the company in massachusetts that design and built the system,so if a woman has male friends she s for the streets
453,i can t watch the rest of this i got half way through and all these soft dudes talking is like listening to a feminist talk about mansplaining keep up the work,her actions will speak louder than her words,anyone else see the video loading but not playing,no gonna work birds spread fish aswell either eggs on feet or small smolt,outstandingly outstanding also funny thanks
454,bra said watch these blue pill soy boys go in the comments and rt a easy n this bro come here n type this,it always will g action always has power over talk,that emblem on rb hoodie looks similar to the lincoln park emblem interesting,i hope the carp don t figure out how to dig a tunnel past this,i love your editing sjdkdk it s so funny i love your vids
455,5 31 who,true dat,jordan peterson sounds like he is on crack,a large solar flare event would disable this system,people like to blame the whole notion of men aren t allowed to cry on woman as a way to say hey look woman can be bad too as if we don t already know that and act like woman created that standard when in reality men pushed that standard on themselves and then took it out on women men show their feelings a lot more it s only men holding them back
456,good to have you back,1 41 why why why can t i be the mvp of the league why can t i be the best player of the league,i find it hilarious that in every video with jp in it the comment section is full of people using big words that they would probably never use lol every vodeo haha i m not saying they are not intelligent i m just saying that they will exaggerate a simple sentence,wow very interesting i have never even heard of this enjoyed it,bro every time you play maplestory intro music i wanna download it again good video
457,guys soy doesn t affect estrogen levels please stop watching 1 video and think it s the truth because all of these studies sourced based on soy are animal studies one is an animal study from the 40s based on sheep sheep have multiple stomachs side note decreasing testosterone is still a problem,dudes in his 20 s and i m 36 younger guys listen trust me he s wiser than me,couldn t imagine a better person to tackle these subjects with jp than rb both of their finer qualities shining through being drawn out by each other,electrify river in texas,i kinda agree with the last guy ngl
458,nigga i fucking love the iranian government,mr dawson came from a bad background only realising and been open recently if there are younger men watching this learn from a man that s been scorned,peterson is fantastic i have used his works and my challenged his vs my own ideas around said work and my own world experience to inform my counselling practice this has been great when working with men and women alike,i wonder what damage this is doing that we ll find out about in 50 years,actually being submissive means ur in a healthy relationship
459,omg it s the iranian government what a good source to trust,he has wisdom beyond his years,trinity is quark energy created man woman higher power,get a load of eggs and drone them in the lakes that would mess things up ha ha,whomst do you submit to
460,testosterone and hormones levels vary a lot based on the person if you think you have low t ask a doctor that specializes in endocrinology not some dork on youtube saying you need to chase this number of hormones,my guy with the consistency,two very smart people picking each other s brains love that,let s be honest this is only at best delaying the carp invasion into the great lakes,clearly im for the streets
461,government using these baby food companies to make men weaker from birth because theres no way with all these studies and all this proof soy based baby formulas r still being made,sub to the patreon,don t forget the hindu shiva the mother is both the creator and the destroyer hindu has brahma vishnu and shiva as the holey trinity holding the universe in balance,not as close as last time but tom scott is in my area and i don t get a chance to meet him,is that fucking bomberman hero soundtrack in the background or am i crazy
462,boys start taking pregnenolone it helps produce t and regulate hormones,expose them steph you keeping it i be calling them out they know they have good dudes in their friendzone they won t give the time of day to,don t forget the hindu shiva the mother is bother the creator and the destroyer hindu has brahma vishnu and shiva as the holey trinity holding the universe in balance,what about the pranksters who will now go out and catch a couple of buckets of carp and release them on the other side of the barrier,it is indeed
463,in 2010 the journal fertility and sterility published an analysis of over 30 related studies involving over 900 men the researchers concluded that neither soy foods nor isoflavone supplements alter measures of bioavailable testosterone concentrations in men building on this study s findings another analysis was published by the journal reproductive toxicology in 2021 for this paper researchers examined 41 studies published from 2010 to april 2020 over 1 700 men participated in these studies the authors did not find any link between soy consumption and testosterone levels sneako believes anything a right wing person tells him have some critical thought,any thing women say men are doing are aint doing thats really them remember that fellas peace,don t forget the hindu shiva the mother is bother the creator and the destroyer hindu has brahma vishnu and shiva as the holey trinity holding the universe in balance,so if someone were to slip and fall in they might die asking for a friend,why can t people just get high and mind their business this guy is on a stage talking to a crowd about something that i d very subjective and quite frankly a load of shite relax man get yourself off stage and just enjoy some weed this summer mind ya fuckin business
464,wether this is true or not i m still not eating soy and neither should anyone else,it goes both ways too a lotta these niggas action don t match they words the truth hurts but that shit will boot yo ass to freedom,i don t understand the issue all we do on this earth is avoid anxiety in various degrees,there are tons of carp in the chicago canals i don t think it s working,idk if it s pretty privilege or what but i subscribed right away
465,i beg that people who praise this video take out anytime to do their own research there is some evidence that extreme amounts of soy could lower testosterone but the overwhelming evidence is that consuming soy products has no effect,steph you are one of the main brothas that helped me accumulate knowledge particularly women i want to say thanks man and if any of you brothas want to subscribe to my channel yall come check me out peace,i have grown my masculine part of my female personality mars in aries 1st house i have been learning about astrology god s knitting pattern the planet mars and the sign aries is our energy drive passion assertiveness it can become toxic via mars being given too much attention which can lead to war and destructive behaviour or mars energy can be repressed leading to depression in both sexes my dd has 4 planets in aries and sun mars conjunction opposite pluto and she used to run up and down the hall to get rid of the restless feeling or she would have a meltdown mars needs action in the body sports dancing drumming competition martial arts etc to vent the energy build up not suppressed via pills,they ve been found in lake calumet which is attached to lake michigan just south of chicago so they ve made it past this and any other barriers and likely swimming around lake michigan waters,at first i was not a samsen fan because i thought his comedy was a bit too derivative of tim and eric awesome show great job but it s definitely grown on me i enjoy the content and am glad to see him addressing unhealthy ideologies and rhetoric in a lighthearted way i particularly like to see him quoting authors who have written more extensively about the topic rather than just sharing his own thoughts and opinions on the matter i d like to see him continue to grow in that regard
466,soyboy is just a phrase with barely any connotation to eating soy products now do people need to take everything literally now i came to this comminity from hamza s had a bad imprsssion of tate and sneako but i think higher of them now,legendary content i watch every single vid,fun times all the interesting stuff thinkers,i remember in anchorage fish and wildlife had to poison cheney lake because some idiot introduced aggressive northern pike into it,for the love of god if you are with someone that you feel like you have to hover over them then don t be in the relationship
467,w sneako for uploading,you too damn cold bro,excellent dr peterson has been ringing the alarm on a lot of things that have been happening for awhile now,alien invasive species are no joke i work in the sector in spain i ve seen the spanish military been deployed to tackle the spread of the jacinto de agua to stop it from moving to portugal,what about their bs has to be debunked no offense meant but that s like debunking creationists sure you can do it it s easy but in the end any sane person will see right through their ramblings while everyone who doesn t spot their cap is too far gone to be impressed by stating facts
468,brandon buckingham sneako,100 100 steph never miss,russell i will bet you will be thinking about this conversation you had with jordan for a while you are very fortuity to get the opportunity,that s my hometown and as a heads up don t use 2 stroke engines those dam fish hate it and jump more,i pretty much agree with this but i can t think of how else to deal with the fact that these channels continue to grow and appeal to a lot of young men like ignoring this problem won t make it go away that s just my reasoning at least
469,they literally be putting soy meat in our school lunch and 8 have been eating large quantities of that shit for a while,wait steph got an e book,our ancient gods in greece were also assimilated into the later christianity s demiurgal sainthood and my sicilian friend dante from the aeolian islands told me that the locals still utter a blessing to poseidon for calm seas when they take themselves fishing in their boats,why not ship the live carps to china as part of export trade the asian community eastern europe love the carps especially fresh ones then once overfished the situation should go back to normal,have my popular internet culture relatableness baited comment as i express my appreciation for the celeste piano riff as a meme and slide transition noise 3
470,soy doesn t affect testosterone levels,the intro literally have me tearing up at 37 i can say i don t need the game just supporting a fellow brother i came across the video killthebeta while i was jogging to the gym classic video the message was clear and straight to the point plus it was hilarious the way stephiscold got on his uncle lol but with all that said this brother started way before that video i did my homework and knowing how far he has come all the way to dropping a book i can t help but to be inspired me i just want to work and do my thing but for anyone out there looking to really get it stephiscold is surely showing us you the way to do it i m so inspired i have to truly find my purpose and make things greater for myself and kids peace g,seemed like russel was triggered,good luck with that,yo celeste music have you played celeste
471,we missed you,females say they wanna be with superman but walks past clark kent every day,introduction to inner city masculinity consists of rap and learning from the biggest thug on the block cuz there is no father,fish have already been found above the barriers this is a huge waste of money,i haven t but i ve watched streamers play it and loved the soundtrack lol
472,5 32 niqqa,leo2001 batman beta 2,amazing toppic but lets face a fact hetro women look for a male with strong lines of masculinity how can being a manly man can offend others or a more femimine woman can offend others feminism is going to destroy society if a war would happen many women would have to go because less and less men are man enough to go and protect us,do this at the rio grande,1 15 maplestory login screen music
473,aha bro clingign on that 25 not that deep tho,steph be calm tho,this restores faith,prank youtubers be like i took 26 carp and put them in the great lakes opps,thanks well said
474,shneako can i come do an in person interview with you i was just in ny last week but i ll go back next week if you re about it we can live stream it i have some entertaining questions and topics for you,all facts,i don t necessarily agree with russel but damnit does he have respect,could just design a system with a small contained section that can fit the boats like a lock and the ability to pump all of the water and fish out to the carp side feels like pumping a bit of water out when a boat comes through might be cheaper than electrifying the water the whole time,actually incredibly informative video i mean i always knew that sexist manoshpere guys were bad influences and mean people i always knew that and didn t like them but this video talked about why they re wrong and i know it sounds stupid right cause they re sexist which they are but it just really helped highlight a few things for me keep up the good content
475,far more estrogen in beer and milk than in soy that s why in the 80s it was all about double cheeseburgers with your beer like a real man hence the decline of testosterone since the 80s soy wasn t a thing back then,these are some hard facts for men indoctrinated into feminism listen to this guys this is red pill rage phase get through it so you can be at peace after,listening to intelligent rational and honest conversation is a balm for the soul thank you,not when you consider how much that would slow the barges,woooh this was a ride
476,gg w water meats and vegetables,who else got put on red pill knowledge from steph,the powerful men have always manipulated women but without that basis women wouldn t be aware of what men mean not that we are animals but we are teachers without knowing completely if at all or maybe we do but women have always been a subject of war because if you kill the household leader you kill the beliefs and that lies within men now just bc i say this doesn t mean you will comprehend it just means you can read at best,even fish needs a passport visa,is it really patriarchy when lynne chenney made him what he is today it is elites and greed monsters vs the rest of us it is sexist to believe that women don t have the capacity to be just as greedy and corrupt as men it is especially damning when self proclaimed feminists climb the very same ladder they claim is the patriarchy it is elitism btw fucking hypocrites
477,5 32 i think he said the n word,i started with darius m,neitherof these two has the faintest idea of what it is to be masculine why do they think they do,they should ve just put up a sign that says no carp,patriarchy is a broader umbrella term than just men in charge
478,he mixed not deep,right here bro,men talk about this stuff most woman don t,tell me humans are disgusting and dumb without saying it,i 5 stared thru t f and t f but i tots got brkn heart and i know i was equal to blame 4 it n stuff but i just wanna project the fackt i was sick on g h
479,i fuckin love this guy,toxicity levels is all women want,so much pleasure in seeing two honest intellectuals discussing deep stuff,why not just fish them and actually take advantage now that they are overpopulated,nothing more offensive than the baltimore accent
480,ignore all those beta males bro they re feeding on views from you,patrick morgan,no one bothered to white balance the footage while editing,that s why bow fishing is popular in illinois and state fishing regulations say once caught any and all carp can not be returned to the water dead or alive nor are any part of the fish to be dumped into the water there is no catch limit any means necessary excluding explosives electricity poison,hey i m loving the content it would be amazing a collab with aba and preach
481,fuck the matrix,aaliyah aziz pretty much g,i can appreciate brand having these conversations even though it s evident which side he s on thank you,oh i m sure the government won t use this too make sure folks can not fish for themselves and be self sufficient,love the empathy we need more of it in this world i love how you express empathy while also expressing your distain they can both exist
482,do you do cocaine lol,on deck bro witchuuuuu gonna listen while i run this mile real quick,russell s point about dietifying the feminine through consumerism marketing is damn good,what about a lock system right at the end where boats would go up an elevator so to speak right at the connection point the water in the locks could be more highly electrified as they would require less electricity than an entire open canal oh wait we don t infrastricture anymore in the us,first dude is a martin lawrence sketch i m sure of it
483,correlation is not causation though there are plenty of asian cultures that have masculine men but they have soy in their diet yeah they don t overdo it like some of these milk toast liberals soy milk more like yuck milk but soy still exists in their diets,the easiest way to attract the female you want is show you are attracted to them then pull back and act like she doesn t exist it will drive her crazy if she s finds you physically attractive,what did he say,right but they could jump so i would imagine they ll jump over the electrified fence,how to debunk the redpill lifestyle try to live it and see if it gets you what you want when it doesn t then you ll know for sure its trash
484,asians are not muscular,coming from a women i don t fw that shit fr he might be telling the truth when it comes we don t like friendly guys but other than that i like men that give me attention and but at the same time you want a man that has his own life and be on shit too,it is interesting juxtaposition that the commercial before this video was the chromebook add with the group of incrediably swissy guys dancing,i would love to bring a net to pickup some stunned fish,lmao just found this channel and oh god do i i love it you re fuckin awesome lol
485,that s because all of their soy is fermented soy sauce is fermented soy which doesn t have nearly the same effect,that s feeding her scraps my g,oops i guess i am a bit of that mom who will just do things for my kid because i do it more efficient faster x,it s how they make sparkling water,not sure quoting a book about masculinity that was written by a woman helped your case here
486,love your content inspired me to get off my ass and im a couple years older than you,i swear a guy did that to me and well we didn t even get in a relationship cuz bitch i pulled back too,how does the patriarchy play its role in this dynamic russell and his guest as presenting,i learned something new today,omfg your nails
487,they take your kindness for weakness still coming comin out strong,done it and i can say it works,besides overprotecting parents now we have to deal with overprotecting governments,we used this at a water supply reservoir the joke was turn up voltage amps and left fishermen in they catch the fish then reel them in over the power barrier hook em and cook em,noah you ve started showing up on my youtube recently so i finally subbed because i watched and enjoyed at least five videos in the past few weeks i like your editing and the content keep up the good work
488,what headset do u use,yes it works,this is such an archaic reading of gender symbols in culture yes the devouring mother is one archetype the overbearing overprotective figure who needs to mollycoddle their children in order to have a sense of purpose for without them they are gone but gender has changed massively in the turn of the century because the archetype of the overarching omniscient omnipotent father has gone rarely does this archetype exist in a family anymore in fact what we have now is a dislocation in the way men are taught to be providers defenders and strategists but they are not routinely sent out to war anymore and taught to fight in fact the lines between hormonal makeup of both sexes are blurring hence paving the way for less paradoxical and concrete definitions of either this is by cause of nature as a result of nurture the time when these biblical and victorian fables were written were times when men had a great weight of demands and responsibility which society does not demand of them as much anymore before then and in more collectivist societies women were routinely seen as power figures and the bodies were worshipped beyond commodification eg kali goddess of war athena etc also the body would respond hormonally to a man who went to war producing more fight hormones whereas now a man sitting at a desk would not need as high a production level of the fight hormones this poses greater freedom to all genders when deciphering themselves as autonomous beings now somewhat less defined by the parts between their legs but subject to environments and most importantly their choices,so what if someone just catches some carp and dumps them past the barrier,1 19 this pic goes hard feel free to screenshot
489,let s report this clown,true it s like poker never show all your cards once you show her all your cards it s over she never shows all her cards,i loved this exchange,anyone up for a swim,so much misogyny
490,bruh can t believe they tryna off u youtube is complete shit filled w censorship stay up bro,fortuna namputu comedy,i feel the use of the female in advertising and comodification in general is the perverted desire to worship the feminine the negated and neglected feminine has found it s expression through consumerism and commerce because it is not being properly honoured socially russell brand on a side note i prefer to feel feminine but do not feel it possible to let it through in the world today i walk down the road in pain with my groceries carless as a female while a man drives past and global warming increases one can feel unattractive it s all so confusing,if worst comes to the worst those carp are going to be a good food source,you are very funny
491,he s back babay,thats gon make her chase you,lol jordan looking slightly annoyed that he didn t come up with the idea that russell came up with regarding advertising and femininity,if you wanna be successful you most take take responsibility for your emotions not place the blame on others in addition to make you feel more guilty about your faults pointing the finger at others will only serve to increase your sense of personal accountability there s always a risk in every investment yet people still invest and succeed you must look outward if you wanna be successful in life,noah i want you to know you have the best setup out of all my favorite youtubers
492,buff sneako is not real buff sneako 10 42,women do this shit to me,lol jordan always trying to have it both ways,mrs mabel defrauded my out of all my money and baked my cat would not recommend mrs mabel,crap takes 0 10

495,like why he is acting like he is the deepest thinker of his time like chill bro u aint shit u are just as superfial as you beard hair like read some books man listen to some real people talk the fu ck are you reacting to,naracia ghirga true but no money either or status,pick up the book iron john by the author robert bly and start reading,this is really helpful for my situation thanks guys i will try her because i ve lost alot trading my own on binance,your vids are hilarious m8 keep up the great work

497,shneako is the illegal wannabe son of andrew tate,i like this,male strength comes from empowering the females in our lives consumerism has replaced male mentoring with buying stuff,mrs mabel turned my portfolio from 0 82 btc to 2 18 btc within two weeks of trade what a genius,what about all the people who lived and died before jesus existed do the cavemen go to hell because jesus wasn t invented yet
498,it s not just soy products but most processed foods however some processed foods like processed meat are still a far more better option than soy products,anime boss everything you just said here couldn t be more far from the truth,i could sit and listen to both of these gentleman and come away 10 pts smarter i do believe,i have never heard or seen any of her clients complain of lost i think she s one of the best,these guys are so funny when they talk about how women don t date low value ugly men but if you ask them if they d date a fat girl they would immediately say no so women have to lower their standards for these losers but they can shit on any woman that doesn t look like a supermodel and it s fine
499,i ve been eating bananas,60 percent of time it works all the time joke this works all the fucking time once you figure women out and can read their body language along with correctly interpreting their behaviour you can even predict their next moves before they even know that they are going to make it it is like playing 4d chess,the virgin mary was the feminine energy in christianity and the feminine energy was a lot more worshiped 100 years ago than now be far when we are pushing women to act like man all time and frame everything feminine maternity having kids care as undesirable what we have now is everyone is confused and doesn t know how to behave with each other as all the social strucutres of yesterday have been artificially brocken from the highers ups down using media insitutions and social pressure,she s sure on w tsap,where is the bisexual lighting
500,when you coming over to rumble man,anime boss this is exactly why i think it doesn t work pulling back works if the girl is acc interested in you,look someone asking questions and hearing the answers talking to jordan peterson this is a pretty new experience to be honest,sure you can work with her,bringing anarchist restaurant discourse to the mainstream anyways everyone go join a food not bombs in their area organize rent strikes and do prefigurative praxis

502,as someone who started watching your videos in 2016 i think this is the last one i m ever going to click on please take a break from the platform and realize how inflated your ego is to comment on every single aspect of different peoples life like your some god who knows better then everyone else when in reality your just a stupid 20 year old kid like the rest of us humble yourself before you try to inspire others or else you ll spread the wrong message and stop saying you are spreading the truth when all your doing is insulting other people for profit it really isn t that deep,rich omar says no need to over complicate things then writes a longer message then the original commenter,always said the main problem with western society is the over protective mother it creates emasculated men who then turn out to be explosive rage aholoics who can t express their emotions properly which in turn causes chaos in all their relationships if you put an s in front of mother it becomes smother,hello am from wales my partner just approved my trading think i am interested how can i get in touch with mrs mabel downey,the maplestory music

504,dairy kills testosterone soy does not,another banger video man keep it up this really helps understand the knowledge of women,the statement from jordan that youtube users are 80 male is just wrong,is her trading service in europe,bell hooks the will to change was life changing for me strongly recommend folks read it

517,welcome back,patrice o neal thats also where these dudes get their inspiration from,sometimes i think that power and humiliation is a human need it s just not in the mazlow pyramid it would be on the bottom we basically live in a mass psychosis with a primitive intuition unconscious and a overly positive persona carl jung said something like the biggest threat of mankind is a mass psychosis which i think we live in right now i mean for example we never got teached in school about dominance hierarchies or how to go through live without depression and anxiety it s like no one ever wants you to be a confident strong human not your teachers not your parents no one so we live in a hammer and nails society right so there is per definition always a winner and a loser and if you re a loser lets say you get depressed do drugs and suicide its totally wanted by everyone around you so it s absolutely no wonder that these things are on the rise absolutely no wonder,in deutschland nennen wir dieses wasser sprudel,these dudes hate women so much and yet make their whole personality appealing to women
518,we love you sneako keep on going,joelwtf same g,been waiting and thinking about this collaboration for ages,tom scott in chicago i was born there i recommend checking out their museum of science and industry they have an awesome foucault pendulum any many other cool exhibits,i feel like these ideas are too old to be accepted today i showed this to my brother and he said you can t fight these guys you gotta challenge them to a duel
519,sneako you need to chill bro that red pill rage ain t no joke,facts bro the beta mindset would have taken over me by now if i haven t ran into steph,the peterson person preaches something to deal with that he has never been able to deal with clinical depression he is so desperate to be visible that it just getting sick the most importantly he said just get that shot and this tell all who he is you discredit yourself by inviting him to give interview enough of circulation of lies and circular support of one liners by another am unsubscribing from your channel and other who support truth should do the same,carp is delicious and healthy,so are these men going to take their own advice
520,aba and preach are more alpha than you,you can say that again,female conscription to off shore wars is 82yrs over due,carp have already been in the great lakes for at least a generation at least in lake erie even as a kid my friends and i would fish for carp in rocky river and that location was only about six miles away from the outlet of the river into lake erie i can t speak to the rest of the great lakes and i haven t lived in that area in 25 years now but there were definitely carp with unrestricted access to the great lakes a couple decades ago,noah needs his own netflix series talking about these weirdos
521,yo shneako i m a ui designer let s get in touch about a uncensored platform that doesn t look like 2008 crap,we all can say that this man has been a true life saver,peterson s statistics on youtube users are simply wrong while more users are male than female globally it s nowhere near his 80 56 of global youtube users are male 44 of global youtube users are female and in the us 82 of male adults use youtube and curiosity,there are different types of carp,great lighting noah i dig the setup
522,goat is back,we all had our days g it s only growth after understanding,i am a woman and i ve lived a very difficult life so as a result of that i had to develop a lot of masculinity but right now i am in a beautiful space in my life where i am finally mostly in my feminine energy and can switch on my masculine when i see necessary my boyfriend also had a difficult upbringing but that has made him very loving and sweet but lost touch with his get go mode it was many difficult conversations to make him see that masculinity is not being expressed i am stressed at times because he s so chilled out and i take on way too much responsibility like i said he s the sweetest boy in the world and would do anything for me so he s realising it slowly i feel so blessed to live my life with him,so what if a bird catches a fish and drops it in the non electrified portion,i got annoyed at the portland thing because i was like portland is the libbiest place on the fucking planet lol every meme making fun of a liberal materializes into a human being in this city
523,paul joseph watson is the biggest muslim hater,steph dropping gems like always,it s great that you re having the conversations it ll benefit him more in the long run to be balanced in his healthy masculine energy rather than operating in his feminine too much hope you both enjoy many loving years together,introduce fresh water sharks next,youtube is now all about exposing and calling people out like lol everyone criticism on other people for their own content is the wave not much original videos without someone else clips i noticed this over the past 2 years nice video

525,when and where is he streaming and is there a discord,bro life ya i couldnt,the masculinity is developed enough in women thanks to being raised by single mothers and having no respect for the male leadership role this whole independent woman thing has been born out of that,wait wait don t say another word i got this it makes sparkly water i don t need to brag you know what i m all about dangerous stuff right here baby,still taking money from better help
526,why does it scream bumbuka,i couldn t find it either the way steph type it,i made it up it s a good idea though isn t it russel reminds me of the children i take care of at daycare when they want to show me something they re really proud of to see that spirit in an adult man was kind of wholesome,speak the human language aka american english,this was posted on my birthday oh yeah good shit subscribed
527,please post your reaction to paul joseph watson that would be amazing,stephiscold thanks bro,that was so sweet,so if you do survive the 50 mortality rate and make it beyond the shore would medical personnel come to help you,11 30 i would disagree that the counter content is specific for one major reason there are no real alternative communities offered that s important because a lot of men fall into redpill communities since it s one they feel prioritized in of course a lot of bad advice is tossed around but the lonely audience these guys appeal to isn t going to be swayed by just treat women well most women aren t like this this is a result of the patriarchy that you should be working to dismantle or stop focusing so much on relationships because many of them feel such thinkings already haven t gotten them anywhere they essentially view videos like those as whataboutism because the people making them don t prioritize tangible steps and solutions to men s issues as opposed to telling them why the redpill is toxic it s of course important to say why redpillers and their beliefs are toxic but until these kinds of videos prioritize alternative solutions and communities where men are prioritized i think they ll remain unconvinced
528,bruh syrian refugees are not rapie wtf there is always a trash point in the good videos,type in the soundcloud app 9 9 9,because he never had a father figure growing up i m not surprised to see him asking that to jordan peterson,why would you make this video now i have to go to this il river catch some carp and release them into those lakes you are making me do this,i disagree there doesn t have to be an alternate solution bc men are not simply entitled to sex or a relationship just like no woman is simply entitled to sex or a relationship with men women are not obligated to give anybody a chance sorry but there is no moral alternative solution to that these guys need to just get over their sense of entitlement they are not owed anything from women
529,tread carefully sneak keep ur message but be less abrasive otherwise they gon swipe u love bro,watching from nigeria,yeah it s cause us men watch how to fix your lawn mower vids,i can t believe he went to peoria lmao and showed lacon on the map,no bisexual lighting
530,0 41 stupid boring slow dumb i hate it,madeby 20 red pill universal remember tht,wonderful i could listen all day to both russel brand and jordan peterson,thank you for taking the ti to do tnice tutorials i know i m gonna enjoy figuring it out,the argument is women can sleep with who they wish to has overt flaws some quantifiable and the others quantifiable if i may sleep with whomever i wish then that man is also sleeping with who he wishes to sleep with unless the argument is that men are constantly assaulted by women who force them into sex sex requires two people everyone is relegated to intimacy based on access availability and their willingness to participate there are amazingly beautiful and kind women all over the world however they are still limited by their access to and the willingness of the objects of their attractions to be mutually invested in pursuing them what their arguments seem to be is that men have no agency another problem half of these videos drone on about is all of women who are for the streets which precludes their desire to be with those women therefore those women do not have access to them per their own admission so both cannot be true so women can sleep with whomever they want just not them but the man who she is having sex must be an unwilling participant as only the woman is with who she wants to be with unless you are over weight over 26 years old had any previous relationships a child or childhood male friends also submission is intrinsic to compromise something everyone does in any relationship both parties will submit depending on each other s stake in the outcome they do not want submission they want ownership over someone else s existence lastly men do express emotion all the time these manosphere videos are all highly emotional you see insecurity sadness pain jealousy hurt anger and all sorts of feelings even if their affect is incongruent with these emotions the words are you do not need to physically cry to express pain or sadness all i see when i watch this stuff is insecurity hurt and pain described by people ill equipped to manage it even if they had a woman to do everything they said it wouldn t be enough because what they are missing cannot be filled with another person no one can make you happy rather you share your happiness with each other or they do not supress your ability to be happy meaning individually happy people are more successful at relationships than people who expect to be made happy through their partner s behaviours you may be happy with your relationship but it should not be because of it that is too much pressure and an unfair delegation of responsibility to the other party it is why compatibility is paramount because you will have more things which you both find happiness in together without having to be uncomfortable for the sake of each other s happiness if all of the women or men you encounter all end the same you re the constant meaning 20 different people from different life experiences met you but your dissatisfaction remains the same then the probability favours you being the catalyst for the 20 negative outcomes not the twenty other people or you should gamble
531,just drink almond milk it s literally just almost water with microscopic almond pulp and also with whatever is in almonds on a molecular level,watching from rhodesia,this sort of free thinking and discussion is just brilliant and frankly a great relief given all of the agenda driven discourse that we ve been flooded with thank you so much i love your passion and honesty whether or not i agree with you at any given point,it s so sad the damage that invasive species can cause because they were introduced as a quick fix to a problem i m sure that most aussies know about cane toads but they were introduced to deal with cane beetles unfortunately their toxins kill a lot of native animals and they now can be found all over eastern australia humans can make such a huge impact with small decisions,the obsession men have with submission is absolutely disgusting and disturbing marriage is a contract no doubt but it isn t a slave contract submission is a very strong word it removes and destroys the possiblity of having an identity the humanistic right to be a free human who has ideas opinions at times i believe men don t even know the true meaning of submission it just seems they want someone who worships them and does whatever they want it thank god i am a muslim woman who knows her rights in islam where men can t throw this submission bullshit into my face i submit only to god
532,what you talking about,what are naija girls like,i agree with most things in this discussion i would also bring into question about most italian mothers and their relationship with their sons as well as cultures where it is the norm to live in extended families married sons with their wives and mother s etc and for many it works i believe there should be a balance with attachment in all relevant relationships having said this my own relationship with my mother can be likened to one of the worst examples of narcissistic and sadistic parental abuse your children come from you not belong to you khalil gibran,invasive human species are the most dangerous animal,men 90 of men outside of tiktok in real life don t even think like this lol
533,welcome back g,all facts bro mugs needs to wake tf up you preaching fam,yeah unfortunately it s something that needs to be more widely understood at least because you understand the dynamics you can strive to change it for the future generations in your ancestral line with healthy balanced relationships extended family and community plays such a role in thriving unfortunately many of us don t have it so we re locked into all sorts of manipulations when it comes to narcissistic relationships you have to severe ths ties for your own sanity and autonomy,the uk s red squirrel population was nearly wiped out because of the introduction of the grey squirrel luckily they re making a bit of a come back,hey noah i just wanted to say that while i love your sense of humor and feel that the topics you cover definitely need the coverage i can t always watch them so i wanted to comment to say thanks for what you do and help the engagement even if my watchtime doesn t

536,you should consume little bit of soy too many foods already contain soy though and soy contains phytoestrogens plant base estrogen they act like estrogen when in the body they did a study with monkeys that showed that they act aggressive and submissive when given soy working out will help the effects but in general if you want to keep testerone levels high try not to consume lots of or no soy at all,actions speak louder than words,hahahaha awesome if ever there was a misnomer russel brand or jordan peterson knowing anything about masculinity hahahahha neither have done a hard days work in their combined lives,socialism democratic way see the public debts of nations no more words,bad boys quotes on wolf pics but tiktok

542,wb dr squatch soap lmao,early gang,youtube audience 80 male really,i remember the simpsons episode but never looked into what it was really about,even if you want to believe the redpill is biology data and statistics that still does not mean the redpill ideology has arrived at the correct conclusions about such things so yes it is possible to debunk the redpil

prove red pill to be true
544,alcohol destroys testosterone levels too,1st of many views,russell you ve enlightened me to realise that jbp needs to focus more on psychometrics and less on philosophy,just build a fence under water wtf,glad to see you encouraging people to check out fd signifier s channel he s one of my favorite youtubers
545,natural fibres in clothes are better than synthetic cotton silk etc are better than polyester,,i absolutely love watching brand and peterson thinking things through,they can t get 1000 fishing boats with gill nets and pay them to clean this mess up we can supposedly over fish everything but asian carp,holy shit people still care about who pays for a date my god i may be straight but this is so far straight it makes me look like a super lesbian in comparison
546,great business idea you should start a business where you sell testosterone friendly products,,imagine if every person on the planet could converse this way the world would implode,im really sad all my great lakes are in danger from one thing or another,but wait if men have sex only with whom they can how are they marring who the want how that works please explain lol
547,hell nah cuz i might have to throw some shit away,,it isn t true there s no place for femininity in the trinity it s clear stated both wo man and man express and are carriers of god s image equally and god has many names among them some which express motherly traits he is a father and most studies show how crucial the father figure is sex or gender is definately not a characteristic of spiritual beings only earthly creatures the lord jesuscrist was a man that s of course historically and culturally relevant to the time of his first coming,or send the sea lions that over run portland oregon to that place,i love you
548,glad you re back keep up the good content 33,,isn t it fantastic to listen to an intelligent conversation for a change we hear so much gibberish anymore thank you russell and jordan,introduce seals to see if they will hunt the carp and play killer whale recordings to keep the seals from straying g into the electric zone,men who don t like women stop being obsessed with talking about women challenge
549,based woman detected have a great day,,jordan is looking well again,100 lies,women stop talking completely challenge
550,anything goes has the gayest voice ever should stop drinking so much tittt milk dairy fairies,,good to see the crazy brand isn t so crazy keep it up friend,close the canal ya greedy goofs,9 23 damn jack manifold coming out with some weird shit these days
551,i love your vids sneako but do you really think 10 years from now you still gonna be hyper and high enegry you mature and grow with age if growing and becoming more mature is being low enegry then i guess we all become low enegry when we get older,,bullshit boys,i guess controlling the spread of invasive fish species can be a bit of a carp shoot,stop being funny
552,glad we agree then i must ve read it wrong lol,,both men and women need to embrace their masculinity but also develop their feminine side a masculine man without his feminine side or a feminine woman without her masculine side will never be able to thrive,what if a bird picks one up then drop it on the other side of the barrier there s eagles everywhere in il idk if they d go for carp though,im cuban yo wuuuutuuuuuuu
553,how many hyper 50 yr olds do u know lmao yes getting older means u have low energy,,jordan is too smart for most of us to understand also russell you are a great host and a very good thinker i like too here you both,my neck of the woods i live about 15 miles north of peoria the carp are a definite problem,this might be controversial but imo most of the time the guy should pay for the date the gender pay gap still exists and it costs a lot more to be a woman think bras sanitary products makeup getting waxed getting your nails done etc we are also risking a lot more in terms of safety by going on the date once we earn the same ammount all these other patriarchal expectations are dropped like shaving etc and date rape scenarios aren t as common anymore then splitting will start so seem fair otherwise it just seems like we re starting the change by taking away the few privileges women had whilst fixing none of the issues
554,i was wondering where you was at i was like season 2 over already keep doing your thang gang,,my public audence praytell jordan where do you come up with these percentages,tom scott having paid a visit to romeoville is the funniest thing to me,filler video
555,bruh i m vegan and eat tofu and drink soymilk every day i don t think like any of those guys energy levels and everything is dialed in the main guy in the video looks a lot more feminine than most of the vegans i know i think veganism can be a little easier for those kinds of men to adopt but i don t think they re directly linked there are several other reasons that affect our test i don t think soy is one of those they guy in the video only showed anecdotal evidence correlation does not equal causation any basic psychology class will tell you this,,youtube literally tells you in your stats of the videos by gender and age,one lethal mistake after another our federal wildlife agencies only design management methods using killing not able to come up with non lethal methods it s so barbaric,i find it so funny that these men say women have all the power because they can fuck whoever they want and in the same breath they will list a hundred mysoginistic red flags like if i ever wanted to have sex with fresh and fit god forbid i would never i can 100 assure you he would not want to have sex with me because like i m not a virgin i m a leftist i can legally drink i have male friends i m on instagram take your pick
556,you completely missed the point this video isn t about veganism,,is the issue of masculinity the thing it s self which is expressed differently in each man n women but the fact it s got a male noun a strong name that s synonymous with men so when women are display masculine traits they are tom boys etc instead are we not wanting to promote inner strength personality ability to stand up for them selves whether it s a man or women son or daughter i feel the antiquated word and associated description conjure negative images based on historic use and men it s been attributed to,if you catch an asian carp you are to kill it and report it inthe lakes you are never to return a live carp to the lakes,i have 4 tom s and a dwindling community of jerry s because of my said tom s and i don t let my wife know about the jerry s because i don t want her to get skeeved out about jerry s coming uninvited into our home jk i don t tell her because i don t want her to fuck the jerry s because she s a woman so she s barely a human and definitely not as important as me because i have a wiener jk alpha male and red pill dudes are silly to say the least it s honestly sad people believe these goons
557,my favourite anecdotal response is that clarence kennedy is a soy boy,,i would like to buy a shirt with a farting crow on it,2 24 i never thought i would ever hear in my life us army and fish barrier together in my life xd us army electric fish barrier,these alpha guys all have such beta energy it s weird they re like don t compare me to your other partners and if you know any other men at all you ll definitely leave me for them and don t care too much or you re not a man but at the same time they care so much that they re afraid to let their partner outside the house yet they brag about this stuff as though it s not hella embarrassing to admit it just goes right over my head i m afraid they need to work on their self confidence because they clearly doubt their ability to please and keep a womenfolk
558,western man is emasculated all part of the plan,,masculinity is under attack because without it human beings become sheep that just go along with what they are told without question,a bird carrying a carp is gonna be your worst enemy,idk if this is related at all but my female coworker said my wife would cheat on me bcuz i let her work and i watch my son half the day while she works and she watches him at night while i work it was extremely uncomfortable
559,who s plan,,debate jordan on communism socialism vs capitalism,so it s all about money what would be the big deal these fish can be eaten just like the game fish they could feed the homeless with them but no rich pricks gotta be able to ride their boats without worrying about getting smacked in the head by a fish,when it comes to women s societal expectations that men pay for a date when does the wage gap become a factor should women be expected to go 50 50 when they are paid less than men
560,lets go sneakooooooo the goatttt,,i find it interesting that peterson has to mull over ignore brand s suggestion that commodification of femininity may be the result of societal repression of femininity in the public sphere as a whole but is fully cognizant of his development of a completely novel idea concerning feminine deities and goes ahead and fleshes it out using the archetype of the devouring mother biased much,so what you re saying is it s no more effective than a net that needs to be lowered for barges i don t get it,never talk about these free things
561,because people join lgbthdtv,,is jordan peterson masculine,all that sweet gear yet no bow fishing footage,i appreciate your opinion so much ty
562,gotta put them on 1 5x speed,,hi russell as a deep thinker bringing on important guests who are intellectuals and thinkers from a broad spectrum please consider bringing on dr timothy winter from cambridge and hamza yusuf from the usa on your show to discuss islamic thought civilisation of muslims in the west i think you would find it very enlightening just a thought both are spiritual individuals,is there nothing we can do about invasive carp bounties for fisherman per pound,i can t tell if you re the best or worst person to have a beer with
563,it s been a long time,,hi russell i ve grown to respect you very much as you ve grown outside of the hollywood celebrity i feel you ve always been this way but now so many of us see your real person you really should be proud of yourself keep up the good work my friend,why does this seem so unlikely to work,i love ur videos
564,this is quite sad tbh,,the subconscious the shadow figure mr hyde in stevenson the monsters from the id,if they shift everything to electric and solar or wind they won t be able to use this method to stop those fish from reaching the great lakes this whole green thing will end up in an ecological nightmare,let s be honest noah the only way we can stop this cringe alpha male redpill guys is by promoting the blackpill once they realize that it doesn t matter how they act or what they believe in because they re always going to struggle with dating since they re simply unattractive because the way they were born then they ll stop with this cringe alpha sigma shit or whatever
565,sneako hammering that coca,,you don t know how comforting it can be to see say you two holding the same basic kind of bottled water i might have as a meaninglessly small detail it provides a comforting symbolic kinship a simple thing for sure but thank you,and why,_ how could this happen to me i ve made my mistakes got nowhere to run the night goes on and i m fading away i m suck of this life i just wanna scream how could this happen to me _
566,man the soy was getting to me this week but sneako back yuhhhh,,my sisters vomit,because military wants to kill of 97 of us,the blackpill is the ultimate truth
567,can you do live on rumble,,id love to know where jordan is getting his statistics from as he s completely of the mark youtube user base as of 2021 is 44 female and 56 male not much in it at all and thats after extensive research not just one source he talks tripe mate these people shouldn t be allowed a platform,but are they tasty,comment engagement you are cool noah
568,the return of the king,,remove the father from the house is total control removing male masculinity single mothers are creating simps that s the game they want going keeps family court full and moves money around yes no,why not just have a dam and then open it on and turn on the current then seems like that would save a lot of power,as an anarchist i enjoyed the tankie dig pls do more
569,more pjw content please,,we see the devouring mother in many modern sit coms two and a half men frasier lilith howard s mom the big bang theory friends chadler s mom family guy louis et al,can they be consumed i mean the fish,nothing to do with the content of the video but why is it color graded so blue it could be an intentional stylistic choice and if so it s not bad but it just came off as weird to me
570,i dunno you scream pissy insults and agress the same way some bitches do the implication of the soyaboy put down being that real men eat meat is primitive and not supported by fact i dare you to call chris hemsworth a soyaboy the way you mean it to his face he s built like a brick outhouse and could reduce you to a smear on the sole if his shoe he s a vegan,,great discussion,this will fail in time,great video keep that lil smug
571,w sneako,,i often pray that i am not being the devouring mother with my boys it s difficult to know where that line is sometimes,ahhh another american ahhh nvm i ve ran out of ideas and putting toxins in water rufff i m canadian and i m worried i ve been worried since i was born since i knew about the us,calling bluff keeping smug
572,lasanabi 2 0,,uneity russell brand,ah yes,don t like the red pill take the blue pill and go back to sleep honey sweet dreams
573,sneako daz trying to get you banned,,i liked jordan until he called a liar my hero,just a matter of time,good idea i ve been sleep deprived lately gotta recharge if i m gonna show incels why they re stupid and cringe
574,original vid,,russell i m so glad that you had a discussion with this person i read one of his books recently you re amazing in this interview incredibly respectful this label of toxic masculinity is definitely revolting in saying that i do not agree with a lot of what this person says certainly there is masculinity in all of us i m still not entirely sure what he means by it as he does say quite mad stuff watch his channel l 4 interview like youtube is primarily male as a female i m pretty sure that s not true i find many of his ideologies very confusing and purely egotistical he s an incredibly interesting figure though keep giving a voice to all peace x,notice how they can t even call them asian carp anymore,josh please relax you re not accepting of some higher truth it s okay
575,hopefully many more high testosterone males will follow suit and call out this soyboys lonely life the return of masculinity let s all start exposing all these feminist males they all sound the same expression sad no excitement boring come on now,,i m glad i m not as smart as doc peterson the man can t sit down and watch a bleedin movie without psycho analyzing it,the us govt should just open up the carp infested waters to fishing humanity manages to accidentally wipe out whole species over fishing the carp menace into extinction shouldn t be a problem,thank you so much for this reasonable video i saw a viral compilation about the double standards men face in society and alp the comments supporting the idiocracy in the video i can t believe people can be so ignorant and shallow
576,blue pill red pill same thing,,i d love to get to russell s powerful ability to learn challenge and construct insightful and deversed dialogue the problem with today s person is everyone is so overly sensitive it s very difficult to have a conversation with someone who refuses to be challenged on their perspectives don t even get me started on echo chambers like steven crowder and matt walsh i dislike the left but man there s something about those two which is sicken,we already fish carp infested waters constantly there is still too many to deal with they breed stupidly fast,what thank you so much noah for bringing those topics to light and make it more comprehensive for the average non alpha population but what kidding you re very insightful and i know very well that patriarchy misogyny and men having feelings have been issues since the dawn of human societies i m just always so disturbed and distraught each time i realize such behaviors and opinions have open platforms to flourish but it always make me happy when you and other content creators of quality make videos on topics like this just hope that not all your audience is constitute of people already aware and sensibilized to these issues and that your videos actually help to open the eyes of people having such toxic views 17 43 _enjoy_
577,the soy thing is just a meme the idea was based on some case study of a guy who drank gallons per day meta analysis does not show estrogenic effects from soy at normal consumption levels this is because phyto estrogens plant estrogens do not effect mammalian hormonal systems in the same way that mammalian estrogen does it makes way more sense to be concerned about dairy consumption than soy consumption hence the vegan response to soy boy being dairy fairy,,russell i could never express how much i love the path you re on absolutely jaw dropping to watch a conversation between to wonderful minds about what is right instead of who is right,i didn t know about this thank you for sharing this i love learning new things about this crazy state i live in less smog and pollution is a good thing sorry i hope it never gets shut down,tell me you haven t touched a woman since high school with out telling me vibes from the dudes in these videos how do they get through their day with thoughts like this
578,as others have pointed out in the comments asians consume the most soy yet their men aren t more feminine poor diet and inactivity is likely the reason for a decline in testosterone you can think of hormones like a muscle they produce when they are stimulated and fed working out stimulates the muscles and thus stimulate the hormonal system since hormones are utilised for growth and nutrients act as the physical precursor for muscle mass as they do for hormones,,the thing i can t stand about peterson is that he misrepresents history communism wasn t really that popular until the nations of europe plunged their populations into world war 1 causing mass death famine and exacerbating the spanish flu pandemic when capitalism gets out of control it causes communism to happen i m not endorsing either system i m just explaining that one is caused by the other moreover communist governments mostly kill people in their own countries whereas capitalist governments have done it mostly in other people s countries stalin killed millions in russia ukraine and poland anti communist nazi germany also killed millions in russia ukraine and poland my dad walked over fields of corpses in vietnam we committed a genocide there because we said that they don t have the right to be communists even in their own country so we went there and killed millions of people spraying agent orange and poisoning generations to come go look at the photos of the baby sometimes but don t do it before you have to eat anything,you were 5 miles from my house,wait you and these weak women and weak guys on this channel are so far gone there s sooooo much tragic disgusting horrible things many not all but tons of women have done and the similarities common occurrences same exact things that many women have done to men and some of us are aware now look at tik tok idiot girls straight up saying the grimy stuff they do the entitlement i guarantee you the majority of women on here agree with this mislead guy only because they re women no responsibility for what many women have done ya all are just against any man that states the horrible things many women do and how they operate in the total red pill is to help men be careful it s to educate it s i don t know prevent suicides most suicides are from men but you can pretend you didn t just read that and pretend you can t look up that statistic majority not all of women today are demonstrating these detestable ways of thinking and acting its extremely nervy of you to belittle men for wanting to be safe not lose all their money because courts always side with the women it s pathetic how you and these followers completely don t care for the guys trying to be safe and educated you care about women what about the guy who was cheated on and the girl had a kid with the other guy and the courts made him pay for the kid of the other guy yall missing tons of information now if there are guys who are going with red pill just to get laid or they re knowingly with a toxic girl and are trying to navigate by learning red pill that i disagree with those types of red pill guys are douschbags i m speaking for what i said prior oh by the way so you re saying men should automatically pay for the meal women like that are self entitled and take a nice gesture for granted if i go on a date i don t want it automatically assumed i m paying for her is she my daughter treat her like a kid what about how women can make money themselves i think if they re independent it s actually offensive to assume the guy will pay hmmm i m not saying all men are good either but you people on here are missing too much but some red pill guys have a lot of wisdom and can help but some of them aren t discouraging to stay away from bad women that with some of the red pill is pathetic btw to anyone that thinks i m just a bitter guy who mistreated my girl and now i m saying all this nope i don t have to social media showed all this many women have demonstrated this it out also the girls on this channel just hate the fact that there s women that misrepresent you so you ll just target men who call you out on it instead of thinking maybe those guys are right not about me though that s all but thar requires a tad of humility which obviously a lot of you girls lost or don t have because your ex banged a better looking girl but after reading this there s still going to be no acknowledgement on your actions and it s just men
579,r u sure cuz i dont eat soy anymore and am now very based,,this is brilliant two of the men i respect the most having a genuine conversation and i highlight genuine love it,i saw a program about scottish fisherman using lasers to kill bugs on farmed salmon the makers of this program should communicate with the americans to see how they do it,you keep bringing up very vague anecdotal examples which kinda points to your redpill take being guided by feelings rather than a decent factual analysis on the gender dynamics in this society you genuinely seem hurt which pains me but your hurt is greatly misdirected really all i can ask from you is to simply exercise empathy and to see men and women as human as one team facing a fucked up muddled world as opposed to men vs women constantly accusing the other of creating this fucked up world
580,soy therapy for menapausal women works because phyto estrogens have a protective stabilising effect on the estrogen system it s not actually hrt if it were hrt then trans women wouldn t have to get a prescription they could just eat soy,,the family structure is most important love has everything to do with everything males that are less interested in their egos possibly might understand that motherhood is near to divinity it is the highest holiest service to be assume by humanity it places her who honors it s holy calling and service next to the angels unknown author we d have a better understanding of compassion with prayer thanks be to god the star prayer of bethlehem verily i say into you blessed all are we that love in the lord thankful for the holy jesus baby of the chosen mother mary given to us in a miracle of the spirit of creation do you hear the angels are singing joy to the world we can be angels mary s angels listen to what she says our commandment honor thy mother and thy father thank you joseph because you know why we re here happy birthday to us all and to all love jesus is our greatest gift thank you for our immanuel peace on earth marcie,carps are a natural species in china however in most waterbodies they are not very easy to find they have an ultimate predator fishermen in fact overfishing has been a problem in fresh water in china and sometimes i sit there for a day and cannot get a single bite probably promoting fishing could reduce the amount of carps in the us carps are delicious but i guess americans would hate eating them for having so many bones,does the red pill also act as a vaccine against formatting dude you don t need to be in a toxic little pocket of miserable men making each other worse
581,small dogs always bark the loudest,,love it when these two get together,it s us why not use gun,i ve been with my bf soon to be husband for 5 years and we literally joke about guys like these it s not rocket science communication is key in any relationship romantic or not women are people and not treating them like people is the biggest most obvious red flag thank god my bf didn t get reeled in with this garbage love to u noah as always 3
582,does youtube randomly click on the ads on the bottom of the video your watching or is it just me lol,,love this topic,wouldn t it be easier to introduce predators to keep the carb in check,sounds like a s word
583,eat broccoli pumpkin seeds and coconut men,,i wholeheartedly agree with the second part of this don t mollycoddle your boys and girls you ll rue this decision be firm and fair for a greater reward and it s the opposite of this that s killing our world there s also absolute neglect the opposite end of the scale which is not good to and it all harks back to balance middle ground,introducing another invasive species to deal with a different invasive species is a really bad idea people have tried it in the past and it has always ended in ecological disaster australia is a prime example,22 00 fucking murdered me
584,i rock with you heavy bro keep that energy up and fuck the programming sneako 2024,,harry potter and disney s sleeping beauty wtf,couldn t they just make a wall from one side to the other,you imprinted on my daughter
585,yeeeaaaaah buddy got the same birthday with ya sneako,,i agree with them about parenting my parent was way over involved and it has haunted my decision making and codependency and at 50 i still see it,for some reason they didn t use machine guns or explosives that s weird innit,these are the type of dudes that make me feel glad to be aro ace edit yea so know women are like this too but still
586,maybe men are becoming feminine potentially from watching their significant other bone another man in front of them idk probably not just a hunch,,the commodification of women portrayed in commercials is disempowering to women by reducing them only to their ability as a sexual turn on,so we are good at overfishing entire oceans but we can t overfish a river the nets could be smaller and apparently the fish is a plenty carp is edible right it s delicious why not do what we do best and overfish the hell out of that species,i always think it s funny when i see these manosphere dorks you know they re all musclebound and jacked but absolutely single because they suck here i am just whatever uggo fat dude in a loving and respectful marriage for being a respectful person weird huh i m also charismatic i guess i ve always been empathetic as well i dunno where i m going here my life is happier than these dorks lives though
587,this is psychopath behavior lmaooooo,,marina abramovic is the dark mother figure in today s world,the demand for carp isn t that high in the us and they still breed in insane numbers dragging colossal multi kilometer nets across the ocean floor is a lot easier than fishing carp out of a river or dragging them up with tiny nets,alpha males are just incels going through their edgelord phase prove me wrong
588,i missed watching sneako so much it will be shite when u get banned,,peterson has provided a response to the women s lib now it s all men s fault movement of the last half century while there has been so much support and effort for women and minorities and so much blame for white men it can be hard to see that for some white men of gen x and increasing numbers of men in gens y and z there has been an uphill battle to find a niche or acceptable role to play in society at large many fail to see how much of this is really an economic struggle with the top 1 and the oligarchs sucking so much out of the economy that poor white men of today have enough of a hard time struggling like everyone else let alone taking the blame for the efforts of our forefathers i went to berkeley tons and tons of brilliant students however there was an almost toxic attitude toward even healthy dare i say ideal expectation that men must also advance in the global society this is also true with the increase of focus belated though it is for attention to the lgbtqxyz etc segments of society who until recently have been nearly invisible though i understand and appreciate the need to have paid attention and increased awareness of all these groups it can be kind of hard hearing for almost all of my life close to 50 years the men are bad and are responsible for all the ills of the world i am deeply relieved that someone like dr peterson came to the rescue of the male agenda and am also deeply appreciative that someone as brilliant as mr brand has provided opportunities for his fans to be exposed to the ideas and responses of dr peterson,carp this fish is one of the tastiest it does not taste dry in many european countrys it is served on new year s eve and very expensive too its not a invasive problem you have no one who wants to fish plus you don t know about the sumptuous taste quality money floats in the river thx for the vid,i ve been vaguely aware from very early on that if i let a man pay on a date for drink food coffee there is an expectation of paying back in some other way like by playing nice maybe some physical touch and ofc the sex and i decided to always pay for my own shit the countless times i ve had to defend myself and my right to pay for my own damn order is ridiculous oh do you know how emasculating that is that is not very ladylike don t you trust me are you afraid that imma f you disgusting but also very telling about persons expectations
589,guess who back back again,,i love jordan peterson,fascinating stuff i didn t even know i didn t know about,the maplestory music
590,this dude seems to care a lot about what others think for someone that escaped the matrix what a fuxking scam this dude in the first 30 seconds spunds like a fucking whiny little birch who blames everything on women oh wait thats literally what hes been doing,,in the holy trinity the holy spirit is feminine say so in the ancient texts,what if the fish just got on the train bypass the whole thing wouldn t they,are you from portland there s no way you made a portland joke and you aren t from here
591,yeah the hypocrisy is real with sneako he became what he hated,,interesting my mind went to lady wisdom in proverbs,my thoughts exactly,why don t people always split the bill or just pay for their own meal split the tip
592,noah samson used to direct rap music videos,,yes the tetragrammaton maps a tetrahedron geometrically if you have 3 points of a perfect tetrahedron the 4th point is implied mathematically and known in the name of god aka the tetragrammaton there are four letters yod heh vau heh yod is the point of origin and corresponds to the male heh is the space around the point of origin geometrically expressed by the radius from the origin this is why female is a vessel the womb you see this in reproductive geometry too sperm are tiny like the origin point and the egg is huge like the sphere determined around the origin then you have vau which means son but is the repeat of the original male origin point but is 90 degrees out of phase rotationally with the original origin point the 4th point is heh again which is the female again the consort of the son or the sister as in apollo and athena but that second female is implied not in to lower the female aspect but simply because it is the 4th point geometrically the 90 degree phase shift of the second pair of points is where spin comes from you must have the male and the female 1st two points to have polarity and you must have the second pair to get movement and spin the 4th point is necessary but is implied by the geometry of the first 3 points the first 3 points correspond to the holy trinity,11 million views jfc,that s what i was thinking wouldn t splitting the bill be better
593,first 5 minutes is a solid cook session,,peterson s ideologies are parasites on religious structure is pure ignorance sleeping beauty you know a disney movie,okay but what would happen if someone say just caught a bunch of carp and released them in the great lakes,small small emotionally stunted man children not even being theoretically able to process the existence of an adult human woman these are the creeps who hit on 16 yo while being in their late 20s themselves so fucking sick of these knuckle dragging weirdos
594,im a vegan and i don t eat soy tbh i m still trying to figure out if eating a vegan diet is bad,,jordan peterson popular by being unpopular,couldn t a citizen just transplant the carp themselves,legitimately spot on considering they believe shit like 12 16 year olds are at their sexual prime and women over 30 are virtually worthless
595,it s not good job keep up i could never,,i really like how you presented an idea as not fact but as something that should be explored to determine if it holds up to scrutiny that way of phrasing is a great way to keep your ideas separate from your beliefs and insulates you from being attacked out of context,if it has no natural predator we ll become its predator,the funny thing about the whole men paying for dinner thing is like there are plenty of women who will pay but for some reason it pisses off these same men they take it as a strike at their manhood
596,soy isn t what you need to worry about just make sure it s organic watch your vitamin d zinc and b12 intake and try to stay as whole foods as possible,,jordan may be correct to some extent about his audience i know multiple women who like peterson s work the divisor on his work is the self determined versus those less oriented that way we have a colloquial word for that we call it based based is not a political trait it means to be actualized to seek actualization and to therefore value actualization the emperor s new clothes,can you imagine billions of dollars being laundered with this project rather then just allow citizens to fish the carp out dry for free,this i went on a date with a guy and he insisted on paying i had just gotten off a 10 hr shift and was too mentally exhausted to fight it i wasn t vibing on him i told him so the next day and dude flipped his lid called me a bunch of horrible names and told me i owed him money for the date that he insisted on paying for
597,it isn t the science backs it,,hi russell i wonder if there is any possibility that you become my mentor please i would love to have some guide in my life and i kind of swallow every word you say in your talks i feel like i have known you for decades on an spiritual level,except they already are fishing the carp out but there is still too many carp you cannot outfish a carp with the current population of us fishermen you d need millions of fishermen constantly fishing the rivers very hard labour compared to doing it at sea so unless the us stops the rest of the fishing to deal with carp or gets a lot more fishermen it ll remain a problem,you re only 24 why did i think you were 30
598,we need your thoughts on finnish prime minister sanna marin s videos of cheating on her husband and child while she was out in the club with other men and mainstream media completely ghosting the video and issue girls on social media even claimed theres nothing wrong with it please please please say something on this you can find the video easily by searching,,there s a yin and yang every male and female have a masculine and feminine side to them and your supposed to find the balance if a society is to alpha male or too masculine we d destroy ourselves through war and fighting there would be no talking things out we would just always go to war,so carp are like the humans of the sea,i love this stuff because it gives me hope that people will be able to think their own way and just live for the future but for most of us now i don t think there s as much hope a more healthy way to outlet whether we want it or not tends to be just not possible but we just accept it in this weird wrap around way that doesn t solve it but helps us work around it i want better for these kids
599,men are becoming feminine cause all they do is sit in a room and yell into a camera about how bad they have it over women,,let thine eye be single brother do not pick from the tree of good and evil only see think and be the good and your life and those around you will have mountains moved,you know those anti mine ropes that get shot out at great distances to clear mines for tanks couldn t the government use something like that or similar in the heavily populated areas of carp explosions under water cause immediate harm to biological creatures i can see this as a way to quickly lower the carp population if it s really that bad out of control,bro thought we wouldn t notice the mario odyssey wooded kingdom steam gardens background music
600,who told you to watch,,you think there s talking things out among women,that also hurts the normal fish though which they really do not want to harm even more than they already are getting harmed it s also expensive to get all the requirements to fish with explosives,my only criticism of this video is that the matthew hussey video was take out of context if u finish that entire video he actually puts those women in their place and tells them how unreasonable it is how much they are expecting from men they just met he also says there s nothing wrong for women paying on a date again my only criticism bc he does hold women accountable
601,hey siri play first day out by tee grizzley,,0 59 the youtube demographic breakdown is about 56 male and 44 female it s been like that for a long time the 80 number peterson might be talking about is that 82 of male adults watch youtube likewise 80 of female adults also use youtube that does not mean 82 of the total youtube audience is male,i highly recommend everybody that s interested in this look at the youtube video done by kyle hill in relation to the rules that the coast guard has to follow in regard to this area,that video was definitely not taken out of context side note people who say something was taken out of context are usually incorrect and trying to cover their ass because they don t like being called out for the bad worldviews they put out for everyone to see
602,keep telling the truth sneako be careful,,fascinating more more more,tonight at 9 electric fish shocking fishermen in the great lakes region and why the us army recommends fishing poles with no metal parts,insecure men telling insecure boys that it s all the fault of insecure women fucking internet
603,be dangerous let them know not to play f games with,,the mistake people make is equating abusiveness with anything masculine masculine energy is sexy in men don t give it up for the loudest and angriest voices as a powerful woman i want a powerful man and shudder at the castration of male characters in movies and tv these days and the way men in certain communities even talk with higher voices to avoid being threatening people who hate masculine also overlook the potency of the feminine the classic abilities to artfully and subtly get whatever we want i think people forget about the gentleman someone who nearly serves a lady and is totally respectful while retaining his masculinity he wants to provide and protect even if she could totally do it all of her own duh men who abuse are abusers not masculine a may equal b but b doesn t necessarily equal a something like that p,damn this video blew up i guess it was really electrifying,going to start saying i m on my empathy arc and goof off mode activated when i do absolutely anything now thanks noah
604,this is why i drink almond milk,,also myself and a friend of mine have stopped dating usa born and raised guys favoring men from countries where being a man hasn t been made wrong north american men are almost disrespectful in how equally they treat us guys from other countries know how to treat a girl like a princess or queen,they must do the same thing to my drinks at the bar sometimes i wake up and have no idea what happened,i hate the whole if he pays she needs to give up bodily autonomy thing i generally like to pay for myself whether with friends or on a date simply because i don t like feeling like a burden but i happily pay for others from time to time when i can afford it because i want them to be able to participate and it s how i show i care it never has to do with expecting something in return and anyone who offers something and then expects something in return which was never agreed upon is gross people like that are difficult because they see the world as black and white with no grey areas but relationships are individual there s no steadfast rule for who should pay or how much sex to have or who should take out the trash because all partnerships are slightly different
605,i only drink breast milk,,for those liberals that think we don t need masculinity for a functioning society you are wrong,gotta say 24 7 sessions of non stop fish tassing is a great way to spend electricity,you look like keanu reeves sweet uncle
606,take a breath bro,,coooool in russell brand voice lol,i have those same rockford boat speakers they are wicked,ok so fanfiction
607,everyone who watches the live streams tell sneako to react to odins men channel,,amazing 2 of my favourite people to listen to,a question what is the purpose of what appears to be several compound bows that are behind you in the opening seconds of the video,feels like an insult to fanfiction
608,make your way to rumble shneako u won t be affected with all your saying and everyone here will follow we aren t viewers we are followers,,peterson claims near the beginning that almost everyone who watches youtube is male i don t think that is exactly true or at the very least is slightly misleading i read somewhere that if gaming themed videos are taken out of consideration then the gender ratio would be about equal,why not kill the fish you say at 95 of the eco stop stunning them,red pill tiktoks make me feel v happy with the person i m currently with bc like damn i absolutely could have done so much worse i mean like who would go out with these people
609,he already has a rumble as a backup why would you abandon accounts with millions of subs across and go to a platform where you won t be making nearly as much money that s a last resort option,,i think he was confused and meant his own audience his thoughts seemed a bit scattered,your problem isn t the river it s the great blue heron god designed them to pick up unmatched eggs by their feet feathers each time they step they have a good chance of eggs gathering under the feathers so when they fly to the next location like a great lake they ll deposit those eggs and your river system meant nothing,how many times are you going to re upload this
610,if you can be on youtube you should stay,,masculinity is all incompasing spirit and energetic presence which exudes physical health and vitality so it is relative,we should do that with the rio grande,not all redpill content is misogynistic and bad and i agree with the confidence and self improvement aspect of it but alot it dose generalize women and treat them like hive mind animals
611,with all due respect rumble is ass and should be the last resort,,that being said there is also a femanine which lies with the masculine and is constantly expanding and contracting maternal instinict based on genetic and environmental frequencies and body organal resonace all due to exterior and quality of food and chemical biological balance within requirements of the individual,to charge the eels,pedostache is still making vids
612,lol remember when you took a gay test and panicked for 10 min about being gay and losing your followers,,i love rb s expressions excitement when talking to jp that s exactly how i am listening to him,what s wrong with fish being in the lake,wheatyboy stans still salty
613,oat milk,,masculinity the ability to make a decissions immediately and act accordingly as alpha male to fight defend gather solution negotiate and manifest a doctrinernal initiative with drive vuiality and the force given with soulful and intent in fairness and game toward a purposeful gain,not an expert on fishing but can carp be eaten or commercially fished for fish oil or something like that could help with bringing numbers down just a thought,i think you did good on this one
614,shneako come to the middle east dawg,,3 54 brilliant definitely the case need not hesitate to see understand this nothing against jp,0 o all it takes is a salty fisherman to transport 1 fish over,they sound like the unforgivable dude but unironically hold on bitch you better not have no lil brothers
615,lactating man nipples,,we need to talk about female toxicity look at adam and eve samson and delilah mary having a baby out of wedlock and selling it as god impregnated me also they decide what we eat thanks for heart disease,you need police fish that catch trespassing carp and harass them until they go back to where they came,i don t have tiktock or instagram so i m just finding this out i don t agree with what this men say however i also don t agree with feminists saying all men should die and writing about it feminists an this guys are all the same extremists why is this even on my feed i just hate people equally therefore i am free from prejudice
616,atheism liberalism the results of an immoral society lead to this,,hey people be careful in this comment section there is a scammer impersonating russell and replying to your comments with a whatsapp number that is not him but it looks convincing the account is called pinned by russell brand it s not him but used the same picture just an fyi,as an american and a fan of electric barriers i can safely say,what i find so frustrating is we forget that we are all human regardless of gender yet humanity always looks for reasons to make existance as complicated and miserable as possible
617,where does sneako stream cuz i cant find his streams on youtube only parts of it like this video can anyone help,,when i was kid my family had chickens for many years we had roosters coming and going because majority of them were agressive attacking others which turned them into chicken soup then we get this one rooster who since birth was different and example of true leader and masculinity he didn t attack humans or other animals except other roosters if they misbehaved he didn t discriminate and took care for old chickens and eggs when chicken mother went to eat he kept them warm until mother returned which no other rooster did raised orphan chicks under his wings and let them sit on his back when we let them free to roam he fed all his chickens called them when found better food and at evening he get them back in barn he was good to us kids didn t get angry when he was involuntary put on kid swings or dressed up for being such amazing rooster he had special privileges and all food he could wish for so he grew up in size of small turkey and had long life until he died of old age that bird was embodiment of true masculinity and earned leadership in shape of rooster,wow so many jumping fish,wait that first guy literally said no big bros what do you want me to do about those commit fucking triple fratricide

619,so sad is there not anyone else you can look up too,,in these discussions the elimination of god and the devil hinders the equation which is what appears you are searching for the equation is simple god made man in an image of himself masculinity comes from god masculine men tend to be leaders women who are also leaders appear masculine when it comes to the question of using women for advertising discussed around the 4 30 mark the solution is quite simple the devil is the prince of this world and he uses the 7 deadly sins of man to entice our minds and souls away from god using women for advertising satisfies lust men lusting over the women envy other women wanting to be like the models greed companies benefiting from using the women anger triggering people out of peace and into anger which is a low vibrational energy gluttony over consuming products in such excess that one does not need there is no empowerment in this type of advertising it is truly the devils work,your literally on an american website son,i m always here for the good soy stalin content to mitigate torment that is human existence
620,am also and women falsely accusing paul shah and famous cricket player of rape feminism sucks,,can you genuinely imagine peterson having fun and enjoying life he s addicted to rules and order brand also seems to have struggled with freedom and seeks religion as a crutch,why does it matter,soyboy stalin i m using that lmfao will credit you
621,that s hilariously sad for you,,i think the world has become so brain washed to what real masculinity is,acting as if trucks are the only alternative to barges as a train is running by this waterway could be replaced by rail as far as i know carp don t hitch a ride on trains is it really that simple probably not the obvious ideas to a non expert me aren t always a good way to solve the problem and sometimes just plain wrong headed nevertheless why not use trains instead,my hot take the one who invites the other on a date has to pay no matter the gender or even better split the bill or on one day you pay on the other the other person pays
622,sneako you need to learn martial arts they will come for you,,did jordan peterson push jabs,uh and how much does this amazingly expensive activity cost the taxpayers every year and up front to build it,honestly i feel like splitting the bill is the best option

624,these people get fake subscribers and comments that are robotically engineered it s a delusion to them because they don t go outside,,mleh boring j peterson,they re asian carp the flesh itself is ok i hear but there are lots of bones in the muscle tissue so they aren t very desireable for human consumption the whole affair of their introduction to north america and release into the wild is another reminder that judeo european colonization and imperialism has been a calamity for the people and land of america in the sense of the whole landmass from arctic to antarctic,bruh to find out matthew hussy is who i thought he was bruh
625,sneako please try and find more christians with great talking points had a lot of islamic perspective from very educated islamic people please get educated christians,,two of my favorite dudes hashing it out to save all of mankind through understanding so damn cool two of my favorite mates hashing it out to save all of mankind through understanding bloody brilliant,how about trawling the rivers constantly and use the caught carp for cat food and some type of feed,algorithm bless you your hair is looking damn fine
626,whoever s reading this i pray that whatever you re going through gets better and whatever you re struggling with or worrying about is going to be fine and that everyone has a fantastic day amen,,hmmm i m female just 20 of us here young men young women need to be taught by older wiser men women to mentor them into adulthood,this will not work it will only delay the carp only solution is to fill in part of the canal the barges can unload and reload it would be a pain in the ass but easier than getting rid of the carp once they get through they could pump the sewage through pipes,great video but where is the bisexual lighting
627,i see you everywhere with the same exact shit,,i would like to see someone talk about the fluoride in the water supplys everywhere in world,so smooth everytnice tutorialng he says goes into my brain and sticks in,so now u keep coming up on my feed because i watched isaac do a response on your response of him i am only 2 minutes into your video so i probably should watch more before i write something but i m really sick atm so i probably won t watch much more of this video so todd i want to know why it s cool to speak poorly about males u don t knoah anything about except a short video clip of yes that was a lame joke but probably better than todd s when isaac speaks out about people eating themselves to death that is a good cause body positivity is good for people that can t change what they are stuck born with not for people that are purposely giving themselves heart attacks and diabetes just like in reverse being anorexic is also very bad i think it s because your either two things it s because when isaac spoke on woman your possibly so far left that u have came around to the right side without even realizing it or u think u will get viewers money possibly puss if that s what your even into for following the p c culture i think this is the 2nd or 3rd video i have seen of u and all i can say is p c is bad for business then knoah one will want to watch but good luck with your channel and if u want to try and change the world u need to speak on there level and let them decide for themselves to change in my opinon i don t really think u do want to change the world for the best i think u just want money or clout and i do hope if u make it that u don t find yourself lonely at the top because that s where alot of people find themself when they reach that spot people may need to watch isaac butterfield to understand what im talking about and why i m calling him todd
628,thank you for ur positive comforting words,,been watching jordan for 2 years and just came across russell about 3 months ago as a female i find both truly amazing people that can help in a new and productive way to express understand masculinity i am raising my boys as a single mom to have healthy masculinity in that they don t feel obligated to follow old patterns beliefs they can mow a lawn split wood and do their own laundry and dishes lol,what are our options for trapping and killing the carp,lol racist much his australian and i do like his belief even if people don t understand how he explains himself i was once very under weight and got alot of judgment over it i won t go to deep into it but it made me workout and over eat to not be seen in that light by about a year after i became over weight for my height i thought i was only having anxiety but when i finally went to the doctors they informed me that i was having angina attacks that were turning into mini heart attacks i was very lucky to get this information in time so i could change my eating habits after about another 12 months this had changed me for the best i felt great and now am able to spend more time with my children without having a heart attack and dying on them it s a great message and just because i want to eat crappy foods shouldn t fall on the out come of my loved ones if me liking this message means i m simping for isaac then i m a simp lol
629,ur everywhere,,you re missing a piece and that is approval,because as citizens were just the governments guinea pigs,are you simping for the fat shaming kiwi
630,bro you have to humble yourself man before the lord man you do come off as angry but there s a way to be right without degrading the other person,,there is a war on having a pair there is a war on family unity both manifest througout all media corporately produced entertainment esp that effing runt disney s company,just wait until i tell my fish friends about the weak spot in the barrier,you really should rapid fire debunk things in youtube shorts if you want people outside this circle to see this stuff there are a lot of people on youtube that will not even click this video based on the title alone i only did to post this comment tbh and i already like your content
631,too many soy boys in this world,,i quite like jbp but it s tiresome when he goes on about disney films,i don t understand his bird logic,it often feels as if these men are bitter and resentful towards women being able to express their emotions more freely and openly than men are my brother in christ other men decided this was the way things had to be not women isn t it usually the older generations of men that have passed these attitudes down from grandfather to father to son when women share these views isn t that often because the societal standards influence them just as much as men besides it s not even true that women are allowed to express themselves more freely anyway so often we are derided and belittled for being emotional and are dismissed because of it
632,1 time for my dawg shneako 0 time for them soiboys,,it really says a lot about where his heads at poor bloke,return to combat area,i really liked the little skits
633,0 35 he just rapped soo perfect,,this has become best you tube channel if you want to learn and be educated well done russell,what a load of carp,content warning this video has a jumpscare for sarahs
634,this dude lying about muslims tho we are no where near soy he s just a jew making us look bad,,attacking masculinity is not good for women not that long ago there was a series of articles with professional women lamenting the shortage of financially suitable male partners two things to unpack 1 that women still view men at least in part in terms of their earning providing capacity but also 2 how the idea to empower women became a zero sum game in practice college enrollments skew majority female today historically women have married at an equal or higher economic level whereas men have traditionally married at an equal or lower level that of course was before opportunities for women became more widespread fewer men in college means fewer at the equal higher economic level at least in a professional sense it is not often that a college educated woman marries an electrician carpenter welder or other tradesman who makes a nice living,this is awesome,the debate with the paying after a date yk i always just say the person who asked out the other person s should pay
635,i missed u,,psychometrics sounds like the prelude to psychohistory outlined in isaac asimovs foundations novels,if these carps are in the philippines this problem will be over in less than a week,no way you know about omerta theyre such a cool band
636,i fuck with u bro keep it up,,russel where did you guys get the idea that most people who watch youtube are male it may be true of dr petersons channel being 80 male viewers but overall i would assume it s near 50 50,ok maybe that was a slight exaggeration but it would still,i can t sleep with the woman i want to sleep with but i can marry her the math isn t mathing
637,god i hate people that hate me and think about it so much i m so cool,,i have always had a love for russell brand even when he was living somewhat off the rails my heart was always drawn toward him and i have such a love for jordan peterson i am praying for both these men to continue pursuing truth pursuing god promoting conversation and exchange comparison contrast of ideas they are both great thinkers and we are all benefitted by them sharpening each other as iron sharpens iron,very interesting,i love your sense of humor but i m so confused because i thought red pilling was something a conservative does to convince a person of a conservative idea none of these videos felt like a red pill lol
638,that dude with the big mustache his face aura pisses me off idk why,,jordan peterson tells a fib at the beginning easily disproved by a quick google search 56 of youtube viewers are male,even with the minor uncertainties and inconveniences around this it s still a good thing there s actual smort people working on the problem my solution would ve involved a lot more dynamite,this expression is also used in the manosphere by incels and adjacent the red pill is in general lines realizing that dating and relationships are a market dictated by oversimplified biological and societal concepts misinterpreted cherry picked and distorted by them
639,he literally has the same moustache as mario which is in your profile picture,,kermit the frog is back again yawn,what happens if there s a blackout,i m so glad i m 30 and past my prime because now i will never be approached by these cretins
640,not gonna lie i was asking myself this not too long ago i ve seen this occur especially in hollywood harry styles donald glover russell westbrook there is a pattern,,best to be the best of masculine and feminine why miss out,another video about my hometown,more manosphere videos i beg
641,nah donald still masculine,,you cannot build unity on lies as jesus said a house on sand is doomed,they the fish will eventually get through the answer is genetics,hold on i m lost in the title red pill is now something that talks relationship advice i thought it was politics left blue right red what did i miss here thanks for explaining in advance whoever does anwser
642,can t wait to see the second millie plaque in the background,,women watch youtube,human intervention causes harm ahhh how i wish corona was actually 100 lethal,black pill exists also how many pills does the world have these days i m european we don t do pills overhere
643,weed also gotta quit the weed weed produces estrogen hence why women get higher while smoking weed,,my biggest issue with peterson is his lionization of individualism,go to lake crescent and sorell in tasmania australia i think they re the only lakes in the world to successfully eradicate carp it took 20 years,for asking someone on a date whoever asks should generally pay or go 50 50
644,you have no point red pill this blue pill that maybe watch a movie beside the matrix just maybe,,i think that masculinity and femininity have been targeted by the elites in the same level of disdain which are terrible news for humanity,wait so the thing is super deadly to humans but a mere inconvenience or temporary knock out for the fish i don t understand my uneducated simple mind proposes a different plan interrupt the canal by closing a section and filling it with concrete have two canal wide boat ramps on either side and install a type of conveyer belt caterpillar tracks kind of like on army tanks get the whole thing working on solar or wind power and make it super resilient the army people are good at that then you can have barges being pulled out of the water and back in on the other side while the fish can t this could work on anything with a somewhat flat bottom or a fin that is removable sailboats kayaks and canoes would not be able to cross it but they can cross it by taking their vessel out of the water like they always do and they re not cargo carriers anyways engineer people tell me kindly why this would be an unattainable idea please,no tommy no jerry krgkadhsja i can t
645,the andrew tate in this one is strong strong indeed,,i love these guys,the rapidly pulsing electricity in the canal tends to cause problems for human hearts which are also incidentally pulsing and are of course much bigger than that of a fish s in comparative size,i love it tysm
646,9 23 that s definitely probably a joke,,i love russell and i m so glad i subscribed i m a conservative and i often don t agree with what he is saying but at least he can have a civil conversation that makes some sense to me oh and jordan he s fabulous brilliant,cut off a humans head they will die cut off a chickens head they will walk around for a couple of minutes cut a worm in half and there is a fair chance one half will live bacteria well they can live in just about any environment magic,the first guy saying girls can t be friends with other guys is bisexual erasure man needs to realize girls have game too
647,bro the hell why you changed so much you used to be chill back in the day but all i m thinking now is that watching another ishowspeed,,what ever happened to the marbarl man,unless someone delivers them there,oooh he got the drip on
648,you re the fucking man sneako keep it up bro,,it feels like women aren t allowed to act feminine these days as it is seen as being weak and childish you can still be independent and in charge of your own life without having to act tough all the time isn t it better to have a bit of both masculine and feminine traits the same with men i think guys with masculine traits are great but i also like guys who also have a vulnerable side,i always turn your videos down to 0 75 speed it keeps my heart rate down,men that complain this much about paying for some food dont understand division of labor nor do they value their dates time
649,honestly sneako spreads out so many lies while thinking he s being woke and he doesn t even realise it like everything he says when it comes to food and water is wrong also he s wrong about women in the sense that he falls victim to double standards just like andrew tate does,,what russell said about feminine being perverted struck me the first time i heard it in the full conversation and it still sounds like the absolute truth,it s only a matter of time before it fails to stop a carp or two,an antitrans steve crowder ad showed on this wtf
650,he literally just told you,,when does interesting insight into the human condition become pointless pretentious pontification i dunno,perhaps this is unrealistic but isnt there a something they can so about the craps like mass fishing nets or draining certain areas and gathering them idk,that is good they are wasting their ad budget on people who won t consume their crap
651,what do you think he s wrong about,,love jordan b peterson he is so wise i m one of the females who follows listens,and then some people gets really angry at me when i call humans are cancer go figure,i think the weirdo in the white shirt said you re not forthright his meaning being that if they sit down to eat dinner with someone who offered to buy them dinner they need to pay to avoid the man expecting sex because it s the woman s fault he expected sex for a meal lot of people have bought me lunch i wasn t aware i was being propositioned lol
652,the soying of huwhite men is an absolute epidemic and leads to the absolute most cringe cucked and sad men that i believe any of us have ever seen,,only he will deserve the name of man and can count upon anything prepared for him from above who has already acquired corresponding data for being able to preserve intact both the wolf and the sheep confided to his care george ivanovich gurdjieff,and yet we keep messing about with nature thinking we know what we are doing and can control it transplanting animals as an easy way to mitigate a problem like in this case and what happened in australia messing with the weather making it rain on command and so many more things people are a virus,i saw a meme how the left call everyone they disagree with incels haha quess its true
653,eh you unbanned,,i loved this i ve navigated between all sorts of different ideologies and couldn t ever quite find the answers i needed neutral discussions like these are so great for exploring new ideas i ve always had issues with the patriarchy but couldn t entirely support the misandrist attitude many feminist movements usually carry with them extreme femininity and total rejection of the masculine can also be detrimental to people s well being i know this first hand as an abuse survivor who grew up with a crazy borderline mother we need to learn to embrace the positive aspects of masculinity and feminity and reject the toxic ones there always needs to be a balance between these two energies in all of us as both can spiral out of control,why not just capture it and make delicious dish,incel vibes
654,can t stop laughing,,oh god same the feminist movement has great ideas of course but not only a lot of those who are part of it are misandrists also the movement has left out women of color and focused on white women for so long,european carp entered australia s outback waterways in the 1970s and devastated the native biota fish crayfish and most of the river vegetative species it took nearly fifty years for any sort of correction to take place leaving the whole system today completely corrupted,tik tok defintley brings out the worst in humanity
655,lol sneako turning into tate,,great to see peterson back and brand is evolving nicely,european common carp didn t enter australia people took them there same as they did in the usa as far back as the 1800s carp have been reared as food in europe for centuries and misguided businessmen thought breeding and selling them was an easy way to make money what they didn t take into account was that in warmer waters they spread like wildfire,banish the other person s friendships into the shadow realm bruhh
656,i m so glad his back,,masculinity in females is not what we need the feminist movement did that and now look at us female s need to go back to their femininity and males need to get back to their masculinity every gender has their part to play in life and both are equally important look at the animal kingdom they are not confused hell we are devolving,inaction of aus government they just don t give a 2 clocks about environment,msthew hussey isnt rp is he im going of thumbnail didnt watch the video
657,why are men becoming feminist simple no father,,i can see why men prefer him women want a seat at the table and to be part of the great universal myths too jordan just never invites them,tldr dangerous fish get tazed,you had me at strawberry elephant
658,sneako saying he s better than them is arrogant however these people he s arguing with are worse than scum like they are literally arguing to argue,,he s always omitting female roles in narratives i once heard him tell the story of horus and osiris and entirely omit isis s part from the tale little suspicious,if you said guess why you can t kayak from the gulf of mexico to the great lakes none of my guesses would be because of a deadly electric fish barrier,you got a new subscriber sir i had no choice but to subscribe after the tom jerry with the smoking cowboy tom after
659,soy has phytoestrogens are you a plant for it to affect you i m plant based and have been for 4 years i m conservative still having plenty of seggs making plenty of gains and living a happy life there is no evidence right now supporting the opinion that this causes a drop in testosterone it is all about intention with which you live and your mental emotional health if you wanna be a beast and a fucking savage you will do just that of course don t eat junk like mcdonalds and processed shit when men will accept that they are men they are competitive they need to conquest they need to workout and they want to fight we will all be much happier regular therapy won t help it was alternative therapy cold exposure breathing exercises along with reconnecting to nature that got me to be the beast that i am love what you do sneako go get them personally too loud for me to watch all the time but definitely we agree on most things,,everytime i hear anyone mention the divine feminine to jordan we quickly tumble into a dark place with the devouring terrible mother archetype,plenty of birds in the background all the time trying to get the floating fish brutal,minimum replacement birth rate 2 1 eu birth rate 1 53 canada birth rate 1 47 usa birth rate 1 70 russia birth rate 1 50 ukraine birth rate 1 23 australia birth rate 1 66 israel birth rate 3 00 israel education minister rafi peretz on intermarriage israel justice minister ayelet shaked on keeping the jewish majority even at the expense of human rights cnn joe biden im a zionist you don t have to be a jew to be a zionist angry foreigner joe biden it s a good thing that whites will be an absolute minority in the usa
660,if it doesn t cause a drop in test how come they all look like you,,i don t dislike jordan peterson but can he stop saying youtube is almost only used by men what i looked up showed 56 male and 44 female he s been using that line for years and it s always bothered me it s fine to have a mostly male audience but stop saying women aren t using youtube,100 murica xd,what are you rambling about
661,i mean the samurai were the epitome of masculine essence yet japan consumes the most soy of all countries all asian countries eat soy yet they produce the most driven and accomplished men and women,,masculinity is relevant because you get those men who are calm and collected but you also get those who are macho they are all men at the end of the day if the macho man knocks out the calm and collected then he owns them and cancels the calm ones out at the end of the day it s about who can knock out who in a bare darwinian sense any civil sense of pointing out the mature and sensible ones that are true men well that s a social construct that came with civility but there is also a side of pure animal and primeval of fists and egotism which was how kingdoms and domains were calved out in ancient times,hey trump supporters this is where all your lost votes are go for a quick dive to find them,_video about the red pill suddenly and mysteriously gets a _ _great replacement_ _ comment_ so your intent here was to make your community look worse i assume
662,copy and pasted,,but isn t the great bugaboo of all time is the feminine expression in men the mortal sin for boys is to show any qualities judged as feminine more condemned then the expression of masculinity in girls both are often punished but girls can play sports boys still cant play with dolls,wow that push boat is the epitome of world class naval architecture you can tell how much effort and passion went into her timeless refined design truly breathtaking and i consider myself blessed to have even just briefly witnessed such a poignant example of fine shipbuilding,my man noah dropin bombs in this video feminism should liberate all i agree
663,honestly sneako spreads out so many lies while thinking he s being woke and he doesn t even realise it like everything he says when it comes to food and water is wrong also he s wrong about women in the sense that he falls victim to double standards just like andrew tate does,,i love seeing both these men talking together i respect both men equally,ecosystem at all,i love your gen z memepower
664,it s also phone usage and microplastics that lower testosterone,,russell stop giving air time to this dog whistling pseudo intellectual,electric water yo lemme just throw my phone in there let it charge rq,me watching noah samsden new video fuck yes haha fuck yeah yes me when noah samsen video ends well this fucking sucks what the fuck
665,that would be correct staying on the phone a long time would take away from workout time but the phone it self would not,,man who suggests that women should be forced to have sex with incels to lower the number of mass shootings thinks that the reason his audience is primarily male is because he s on youtube lmao,americans and their complicated solutions why not just put nets,ahh thank u king 3
666,let s go baby,,i wasnt expecting this to turn into mainly a discussion about disney characters,flying carp fly barges do not any net high enough to prevent fish would surely be high enough to impede ships,wren is kinda some liberal shit products and services aren t gonna stop climate change
667,i told that soy boy with the mustache to come debate live but he made execuse t,,can you learn to be masculine,because murica,things that aren t products or services usually do not sponsor videos
668,it s the absence of religion mainly and the dilution of religion and culture countries can still maintain masculinity and tradition if they are irreligious as long as there is a strong unifying culture like in china china has its own problems on account of state enforced atheism but manliness is not one of them yet in the west people have been taught to hate themselves hate their ancestry reject all forms of tradition and have been pushed to the side by feminists who walk all over weak men those same weak men think obeying feminists will get them rewards either from women or from the state if you think america is bad take a look at western europe particularly northern europe absolutely disgusting level of effeminate men there they have 0 backbone 0 red blood nothing it s a disgrace men need something to fight for or defend if it isn t god then it must be a nation if you have neither it s over when men have nothing to fight for or defend they don t need to be warriors when men can be weak and thrive in a weak society they will stay weak go look at the map chart for europeans who would fight for their homeland there s a severe contrast between west who hates itself and east who is restoring traditional orthodox christianity and slavic culture it s sad,,i m glad you are starting a tribe russell no one else is stepping up i m a woman who has been in support of what jp has been saying for a few years now i ve also noticed the importance of supporting men young men and masculinity this enables women to be more feminine also re your comment about the neglected feminine and females used for advertising i heard that men operate on a more visual level and therefore if masculinity operates more on the visual level then this is a reason why using females in advertising appeals to both sexes if we have both masculine and feminine within,ok ok yt recommended i relent i ll watch jees,broo the animals as fruits with arabic text caught me so off guard
669,guys eat sweet potatoes for the dicc gains,,can t believe y all didn t mention water boy,the thing i find funniest about the situation is that they are nearly extinct in their natural habitat westerners find them disgusting but like everything else they re considered a delicacy in china so they have been overfished they are now buying them from the us,cucked and bluepilled
670,bro was really talking his shit wneako,,the population is easier to control by the elites if the men are all gender fluid effeminate pansies hence the bombardment of social conditioning,a lot of coulds in this and a lot of money going into stopping carp migration when all it takes is one guy that hates everything going on to box them up and just move them over,the objectively correct answer to who pays for the date is whichever person first proposed the date there is literally no other acceptable answer
671,sneako the goat w or l in the comments,,good jordon halts up his point,i live off lake heron and can say the great lakes defiantly have carp,7 37 well no because when people tell hurt men to go to therapy what they really mean is you re weak your emotions aren t valid i m mocking you you re pathetic it s what we call a quadruple entendre i mean seriously do you really think that on the left the same left that will relentlessly bully you on twitter over fucking neo pronouns really gives a shit if we go to therapy or not
672,never in a million years would i thought i d see sneako reacting to paul joseph watson lol,,might be a fluke as i propagate assigned partners because some boys can t get laid,i wasn t watching with my eyes but i was expecting the guy explaining the system to be in ocp s,um you ll probably not read this since i am two weeks late to this comment but i am someone studying to be a psychologist and i literally say that to everyone when i see that they might need guidance to work through their issues the fact that you think that me saying that is invalidating your feeling and calling you pathetic shows me your opinion on therapy i think its a powerful thing to go to therapy it takes a lot to actively work on yourself sometimes you alone is not enough and thats okay i just want you to know that there are people out there who say statements like go to therapy because they genuinely want you to heal and work through what hurts you i won t lie to you that there are many communication barriers in society today and it sucks but i have some advice for you if someone says this to you and you think they might be invalidating you say that to them and ask them to clarify to you if that is not their intent therapy is an amazing resource especially when you find the right therapist for you which might take time but who said working on yourself is easy i just want you to know too that your feelings are valid and therefore you should be open to expressing them in order to understand the intent of a person i get taught this a bunch in school about the importance of separating intent vs impact because you might not intend to cause harm when you say something but that doesn t take away from the fact that the things you said hurt someone else i can talk about the problems with communication for hours but yeah i just felt like saying my piece i hope one day therapy can help you as much as it has helped me which is why i went on this rant if you got to this point thanks for tuning into my ted talk
673,i m so embarrassed that i watch the try guys,,when mind is inside body russell brand,if 95 of the biomass in that water why not just electrocute the fish,this is sad watching a bunch of men with no experience with women talking about the one thing they can t understand honestly these men must have been hurt pretty freaking deeply to have this pathetic worldview
674,brav is testosterone levels at such risk now i wanna know my levels,,technology has changed our societies so much we re leaving our instincts behind and then need intellectuals to make sense of the consequences,why don t they add lock gates also it would make the ships go slower they can run higher voltages and when the fish and stunned they take the carp out and supply the restaurants,i usually don t comment because social interaction fucks with my anxiety but let me tell you when i heard you yell fuck you sarah i died of laughter because that is my name and i was not prepared to have you call me out
675,i stand by alotta things sneako says but do not drink tiddy milk i made that mistake at a friends house not talking about it,,jordan is the archetype of the devouring father,they don t add lock gates because there are lock gates in all the places were one might want to put lock gates,there is r menslib
676,please talk about it not judging what happened,,then why don t we talk about femininity being in both men and women,he reminds me of connor o malley,breadpilling the redpilled quoting books that i read pilled
677,does it taste yummy,,that s haram for peterson,great work bro you explain the whole things very clearly thanks for sharing with us,these guys act like high quality women would even want them they all seem to want women with highly traditional religious values yet i cant imagine that any of these women would be interested in fools like this especially when these lads brag about their body counts all my religious girlfriends say they want a pure husband lmao
678,noah samsen is giga incel status,,jordan is a canadian embarrassment,anyone wanna go for a swim,i m not even religious more traditional though and that s what i wanted
679,yo shneako u gotta drop the first day out freestyle,,masculinity had to be disempowered the alpha had to be marginalised so that an age of sheepish compliance could ensue,why is no one else talking about how wrong he said algae it s al gee,this is so common in my culture men with heaps of past relationships wanting to settle down for a pure woman who hasn t been with anyone before
680,you gotta just not talk about these people,,excuse me women far from need any form of masculinity tho if you re talking about fighting combat etc that all comes under the feminine,he is british so he uses the british pronunciation,my religion requires both men and women to be pious and not having relationship before marriage so if my husband wants me to be pure i too would definitely want him to be pure too
681,bro get some new content it gets old and boring,,this was great to revisit i can t wait for these two to do another podcast together,how did you the ad the well i guess thats a tom scott video for ya,shouldn t he be waiting for marriage if his hypothetical spouse is also waiting
682,found you through nick fuentes good content,,how did a discussion about masculinity end up discussing the devouring mother myth it has been easy to blame beleaguered mothers when fathers have largely been absent due to the imperative to fulfil their largely constructed by establishment manipulation societal masculine functions such as cannon fodder wage slavery and striving to become the alpha male within the malthusian social darwinian landscape that is the neo liberal economic horror show we inhabit we are animals that are mammals first human beings homo sapiens second and male female or somewhere on the continuum thirdly we are a part of our environment not apart from our environment that is what needs to be learnt by the hyper masculine structures we are forced to live under competition domination the cult of the narcissist are all manifestations of the priorities of a world out of balance and the danger of being out of balance is there will be a fall that will affect all,great plot for a horror movie,i am deeply religious and yes a pious man is preferred you re correct
683,because they cant be masculine but they want to be somehow so they turn ridiculous,,i love russell i really respect peterson,and they say they are saving ecosystem,tell me why the first dude sounds like lina lamont
684,l taking wifes last name,,true masculinity is a good thing men devoid of it become weak and therefore toxic spiteful and abusive,shut it down southern illinois dont care about chicago,i met my wife in high school i kept telling her how much of an insecure loser i thought i was she said it didn t matter still loved me we ve been married for 14 years and going strong it s ok to talk about insecurities with the right partner i promise
685,bro i like and unlike then like again on your videos lately,,could listen to these 2 for days,closet full of red shirts ok mark zuckerburg,yep just like when it s right getting to know someone you like who likes you back is super fucking easy none of these mind games or superficialities
686,long live the legend that is shneako,,i honestly think demonizing men or women is stupid the honest truth is thoughtful people in general are hard to find and most people are running around with some version of ptsd whether they know it or not,uhhhhh i live in kenosha wi fish michigan often there are definitely carp in there i catch too many,that s only if you have already build up a solid foundation though i don t think it s attractive to already talk about insecurities when you just met someone
687,yesss your back,,thanks for posting this and the link to the full interview fascinating discussion covering a lot of ground given that it goes back a few years i wonder whether dr peterson s position on the spiritual has moved closer to yours after his own recent experiences,there s native carp but the invasive carp is different,i also knew my husband in highschool but we didn t date until college we started off as good friends and built a strong foundation of trust before we finally pursued each other romantically he is especially in touch with his emotions and has never been afraid to share them with me we dated for 8 months before agreeing to marry and we ve been inseparable ever since i think more men just need to be more honest and willing to share their emotions to form deeper relationships too many people are looking for quick hookups now which almost always ends in dissapointment true love takes time and effort
688,i never consumed soy in my teenage years and my friend as well and we still have gyno,,the majority of us are so incredibly fortunate to be at a time in civilization that meaning can be found in conversations such as this,i sometimes wondered how bull sharks who have swam up as far as alton il in the mississippi river didn t continue into the illinois river and make it to the great lakes now i know one reason,finding that right partner is very difficult you were incredibly lucky to find them in high school
689,but that s impossible just about every processed food you eat has soy in it no matter what,,holly crap almost everyone who watched utube are male when in early 90 perhaps total crap,i am a bull shark and i disagree i currently live in lake ontario i would tell you my story of how i got here but it is hard to type with fins,no one is dating in high school anymore and people change overtime and become more transactional
690,shneako watching u is like watching myself sometimes ty for being authentic,,7 10 are we getting canceled over that,from that time jesus began to preach and to say repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand matthew 4 17 ye have heard that it hath been said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth but i say unto you that ye resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also matthew 5 38 39,cringe is when woman exist ayo these misogynists kinda based maybe they should stop existing as well
691,only a few of us left brother,,to many masonic signs on show,amazing work love the words from the engineer,the fruit animals im dying
692,i was suggested a nickisnotgreen video once before shneako was a thing i watched it for 10 seconds got bored went back and pressed that not interested button,,i don t feel like i m overprotecting my children but i was certainly neglected in too many ways i see the effect that s had on me and my siblings it feels like the worst possible outcome,what about a net,the healthy bois rant is unironically a decent recitation of kant s categorical imperative
693,keep doing you bro i disagree with shit you say but your more entertaining then people telling me how to think about others,,jordan peterson the man who has an opinion on absolutely everything oddly has no opinion on the plandenic or the death jab in fact he has been largely missing in action my conclusion he is a giant fraud,sheldon reservoirin texas had a carp problem a bounty was offered by the pound,that first guy that keeps popping up sounds so insecure and so stupid he is so easy to see right through it s sad truly he also seems like he has the intellectual capacity emotional maturity of an 8 yr old
694,yeah fuck echo chambers lol i m vegan and eat soy all the time and my t levels are high af it s just the lifestyle that matters more than anything else i disagree with most of what sneako says but like you said he s entertaining af,,i still seriously dislike peterson,wonder if they will adapt to the electricity there are electric eels,matthew husey is not red pill
695,same bro i disagree with him in a lot of spaces but holy shit do i love how honest he is,,i m happy to be one of the yt women watched him since 2016,i just don t understand why in china it cost very expensive but here they don t want it,how far back do these guys have to hold their head to force those stupid ideas out of their mouth even the first guy talks so you can see up his nose
696,i disagree with a couple of his point every now and again but he is still one of the most authentic youtubers rn,,this was a great convo i got a lot from this,why don t we invite the chinese fish companies to net these carbs out make them no tax and free tariff,get over it feminist
697,link to that college girl pls,,feminity is the biggest problem at the moment overly emotional men feeling everything completely detached from themselves,isn t dc voltage that pulses just ac voltage at a lower hz,liberal destroyed
698,just drink almond milk honestly cow milk had estrogen as well,,russels selling you all down a river or in it like the pied piper beware wolf in sheep s clothing,just tell everyone that carp are edible and good for cat food and the carp would be cleaned out in a jiffy from over fishing,great comeback bro you totally destroyed that liberal
699,that dude is he is a bit of a soy boy debunks the manosphere etc,,two intellectual giants,so to solve world hunger we need a carp recipe,is the music from bomberman sorrry super distracted go off mister
700,did you just call aba and preach soy boys take that back right now,,please investigate us filing on gov w blower affidavit swearing with evidence that 45k died within days of that which shall not be named,a california lake had a problem with the northern pike being an invasive species fish and game poisoned the entire lake imagine the smell of every fish in the lake coming to the surface dead but most of them were pikes,i don t want men to pay for anything because it makes me feel like i m being pressured into fucking them if i say no
701,i m subscribed to both they are kinda soy boyish have you heard of the story of aba jumping into the bushes,,peterson dont over protect your children don t help them as much as possible daddy can you get me on joe rogan no problem,how 2 3v can be dangerous to a person i mean a car has 12v and unless you put two wires to your mouth it will not harm you,man i remember when in an ice cream parlor there was a couple ahead of us in line and the woman paid for both ice creams and the woman who attended like congratulated her saying that we had to remove that idea that men had to pay for everything and it was turn of women to invite stuff too or something along the lines
702,pjw is a king i really recommend everyone watch him to see the bs in the world happening around us,,i love seeing you guys bounce off each other mesmerising,this was fascinating o,women will marry who they can and men will marry who they want so is the implication here that when the men marry who they want the woman they re marrying don t want them
703,the only thing he is the king of is the closet,,everything disney does is about an sjw fempowerment narrative they certainly aren t above producing a deliberate pre planned flop if it serves to reinforce these narratives in future movies for disney there is only one sex,so this human interaction we ll see the damage from in 20 50 years i assume,another banger keep coming for him sponsors we need more noah 3
704,and super anti immigration and a racist he s like the straight slightly politically correct milo yiannopoulos,,russel is one of the few individuals that is bridging the gap between people that the culture war has destroyed good work,these fish will soon find away to breach this check point,for the algorithm love your work my dude
705,welcome back the bro that i dont know,,men don t need guidance but we seem to be constantly bombarded with thie idea that we really really really do from those who aren t men the neglected feminine also expresses itself in other ways for example being rubbish at parking a car inverse punctuality gossiping whinging femsplaining and the inability to see humour in stupid youtube comments,i don t see they can t build another electric fence 5 miles up river kill off everything in that 5 mile stretch restock it with native fish and then do the next 5 mile stretch,you gotta do the pink pill now for equality
706,i love how he listened to the brooklyn wine mom and moved the sneako light w,,fairy godmother it s up to you to get back before midnight cinderella placing the responsibility on the child,0 02 fishy jumping for freedom,the chill lofi christian music playing behind the guy saying you care too much about the b tch is really the icing on the cake for me
707,what s up with muslim refugees,,let him talk,like some type of fresh water sea bass just be happy they didn t release easter eggs into the water,despite my disagreement with the red pill community many of their statements are valid only when in contact with toxic females and the strategies that they present are usually use for men who have little to no experience with women or have a very negative response where they have a high experience with negative females the community perpetuates stigma which leads men to actually openly seek out the women that they complain about because they seem more genuine in the same way women choose to guys who are assholes because they have a perceived notion in their head that most men are assholes but they re just hiding it both sides are hurt
708,outside today 2 ft nba youngboy,,yeah i always feel that about the trinity i can t seem to stabilise it is the holy spirit neutral as conventionally claimed or a feminine energy analogous to the shekinah but then how can mary be impregnated by a female energy are we going to have to wait for jesus s return in female form to balance the equation i speak as a confused christian feminist who often thinks they will vomit if they hear about god the father one more time let alone repeat it through gritted teeth and anyway any creator worthy of the name surely should never be anthropomorphised in this way tho i sorta like the image of mary as queen of heaven which means she must have a male counterpart but then i m back to the male sky god thing also she has a counterpart in buddhism guanyin or kuanyin or kanon depending on where you are and she s based on the hermaphroditic buddhist hindu avalokitesvra the compassionate buddha,all good until the looming power cuts hit,men i hate it when women give up sex so freely also men goes to a strip club men sex workers are awful people who should be ashamed of themselves also men logs on to the hub 10 seconds later i really don t understand how they can be so contradictory they literally support the women they supposedly have problems with they re like if someone said i don t like it when people do drugs and then goes out on a street corner to sell crack they re literally the source of their own problems strip clubs brothels sex work phub would not exist if it weren t for men and their lust but no its all women s fault
709,immature and being lit aren t necessarily contradictory things,,my youtube audience is 50 50 male female s haaaah i win lol,i m wondering wouldn t it be much cheaper for them to make layers on layers of huge mesh fences both above and below water in the canal so the carp can t come through edit i guess they need to be able to move barges through,we live in a society that if you tell women there actions are not very good for relationships or marriages you will be called a misogynist and then you wonder why men are not taking a lot of you women seriously i doubt noah samson will ever have a debate with one of these red pill content creators who have statistics and everything and can show you how much the dating game and women behavior have changed ever since the introduction of social media in the late 2000s and early 2010s men simply do not hate women men have just adapted to the game and will not be manipulated by the mind games some of these women play
710,i am a vegan and i have made massive progress in the gym more muscle then ever more boners then ever i feel much more masculine and i feel like beating up everybody i hate it s not soy that s turning men into women it s the stuff they believe in i very much agree with sneako on everything but this soy thing is just not correct soy is not making men more feminine it s the stuff they believe that s making them more feminine p s for the vegan haters i m probably more manly than you are rather than working on yourself you are here bitchin on the internet about vegans and how weak they are but just look at you do some research before commenting about veganism and go lift some weights you need it,,pure gold give me more,i hope aliens don t watch this and see how stupid we are,lol dude litteraly said we live in a society has to be a troll
711,yeah keep it up and see how long you last compared to someone who eat meat and not soy product,,russell and jordan you gotta thank god for having a good running memory to remember a lot of stuff,blasted watching this,see what i mean so many of these dudes literally tell young boys that woman play mind games and are manipulative due to their own experience instead of giving an actual lesson
712,cringe vegan moment,,sleeping beauty is about the girl coming of age has to stay virgin too long so she becomes depressed not beeing allowed to express her femininity she is alive but dead inside the godmother is the symbol of culture staying virgin too long because the family only thinks a prince is good enough not a neighbor boy or gardener or plumber so finally the prince knocks her up the story is told to girls with the message if you wait longer you might get a partner who is a greater catch its from the time when girls couldnt improve their own status or forfill their ambitions with their own career it had to be via the man so all you could do is stay there and look beautifull sleeping beauty is about just that objectified as beauty that is the only thing you can be a body her mind is asleep she is only a beautifull body if that curse isnt broken she will die,petroleum from your boat and your lipstick ruin nature,that s because have of it is literally just saying woman should always be traditional submissive housewives that s the problem so please stop
713,but soy produces estrogen in men soy is not good for men i would really consider you replace your soy with chicken,,what is masculinity isn t it cultural and contextual isn t it a belief,this is just balloon tower defence irl,i don t care what you do i wanna watch it
714,w for you man keep up doing your thing and great things will come to you,,the netherlands lost their most devine masculin man peter r de vries proud containing crimefighter journalist legal advisor elevating victims and changing the legal system a hero his courage made everyone around him step it up and not accept defeat and never give up to clean the country from organized crime we must call their bluf and stand tall in his memory an icon against cowardism,bro in twenty years there s just gonna be electromagnetically desensitized fish all up in the lake,please please please do a video on what to do if a feminist is accused of being a man hater if she doesn t equally advocate for men s rights i can t find a good video for the life of me only women hating videos
715,bro why did an ad come up promoting silk milk,,masculinity doesn t exist it s just the antithesis to all other,why weren t nets used as a barrier to prevent the fish,i don t know of any video but this argument sees bizarre it implies that everyone who isn t actively advocating for a given cause is automatically and actively against it doesn t it
716,i respect what you do you are yourself and dgaf what others gotta say,,russell brand and jordan peterson did i enjoy this me yes very much,nets prevent barges,i am thankful i never fell for this clown sh1t even when i was in these circles and who is supposed to pay for the date it depends
717,riding that hard ain t you,,eros is and men even women mind are being controlled by the new drug pornography,how about a bubble net maybe a bubble net would work,i think who pays depends like very complex 1 you can t ask someone out and expect them to pay 2 your incomes should be taken into consideration like is one of you in full time employment while other is a university student is one of you mainteined by your parents 3 if you are a lesbian couple and a straight dude makes a threesome joke request he now is legally obligated to take you to the date if you want to and needs to shut up and pay
718,being a feminine man allows me to opress women the most,,again the counterpoint is precise the conversation is fluid and coherent and the content is spot on to the current socially malevolent bias towards individuality and self reason,i love how he points out the city s only care about money and not there own environment money made them care that s it,thanks for another banger noah love the videos every time you release one

721,i actually don t agree with most of sneako s opinions but i do hate that pos noah he s an amber heard supporter he doesn t wanna admit it cause half his audience are men so he can t openly support her but ro ramdin made a pro ah video and he commented saying he agrees ah who is a confirmed abuser who said nobody will believe you cause you re a man while beating jd and that s who noah supports,,nothing better to start the day than a bit of russell b and jordan p,hehe at 3 32 there is a duck on the left d,this sounds like my relationship i dont get to have friends especially any guys which 75 of my friends have been guys my whole life so i have noone to see or talk to i have to be there 24 7 365 i wasnt even there for my bunny that passed bc he wants me with him i cant do things on my own the youtubers i watch in his words are losers and pathetic anything i like is stupid my choices and feeling are not valid to him now i start freaking out when im by myself i always feel like im going to do something wrong and get yelled at it really hurts that i dont feel like myself at all anymore its quite scary sad and even a bit dangerous at this point with other things going on i want to show him this video but i know he wont listen or give it a chance
722,this is fucking terrible,,jp is my favorite please do more with him,carp are edible i m surprised some company hasn t moved in to process them into food sure beats bug protein,i am redpiller but hey imo you might be in abusive relationship maybe try moving back in with parents to get away from him or you could just break up with him even though i know it might not be easy
723,we back,,you need to post all of this i feel like we are missing the rest,but what if i catch a bunch of them and take them up stream a couple miles and release them,11 20 homestuck music
724,when you realize that the more these haters make videos on sneako the more money they get potentially in essence sneako name is paying their bills they better thank the man,,magnificent russell,i still remember when obama didn t do anything about these carp when brought upon attention,good stuff
725,all youtubers be making vids about youtubers we could say that about anyone,,plot twist russell brand is a female in disguise,30 kilos where you from,the thing about the guy talking about paying for dates is that so many men will pay if he likes the woman enough and i m willing to bet he would too
726,i ve been drinking soy milk since i was a kid and i m 17 now i think i m fucked,,russel brand u are what i think but not say because im not sure im around people who can have these conversations every time i think of them,need to do the same to rio grande,this thumbnail is fire
727,i guess idiocracy is coming true meh,,we need more than 8 minutes,it seems like catching these fish would be an easier solution if 95 of the fish are carp and if releasing poison is already a frequent occurrence surely the land of a thousand nukes could come up with a solution,those fruit animals were arabic puns and they made me laugh thank you for representing post ironic arabic internet humor
728,that testosterone video is a bit old science has investigated further and the results are inconclusive see does soy decrease testosterone by biolayne if you are into it other factors have a huge impact on testosterone diet deficiencies sleeping patterns lack of exercise and overweight obesity,,true christianity has taken hold nowhere and it never will even the church burnt true christians at the stake and that will always be so fodder for lions we shall be,birds can carry the fish over,the maplestory music took me on a really aggressive flashback that i wasn t prepared for tysm
729,what is the british guy s name,,there haven t been true christians for centuries,damn you were in my areea and i didn t even know i d have loved to stop and say hi,i paid for one of your meals today so i get your body it just doesn t make sense how they don t see that as a trap is beyond me i can t think of another situation where that mindset would be ok if it was that important it d be discussed beforehand but you ll also find they tend to just leave it unsaid until the bill is paid well after the time that you can opt out gracefully every girl i personally know would either split or not let the guy pay because they feel like they re obligated to do something in return and don t want that what s funny is that there s a lot of guys who react negatively when hearing split check and that s a bad look but among friends it s normally the party that invites is the one that pays and that s to avoid split check hassle if we re offered a split we take it this is just between my husband and i another couple we re friends with and we ve talked about how we probably have equaled out in paid bills after all these years of mutual i ll treat tonight dinners no wife swapping needed
730,paul joseph watson,,rubbish re essential yearnings,so in essence it s an open air aqua battery i m surprised that grass grows near it would be an excellent place for those that tend to absorb electrical currents to avoid at all costs,or or maybe everyone should pay for what they eat drink why do people pay for others aren t you on a date to get to know the person you re with why should they pay for you just because they asked you out didn t you accept to go on that date because you were interested as well or are you doing them a favour on going to the date so they sould pay you not talking about you but in general i just don t get how it s not how everyone operates it seems so logical and basic for example when i asked my friends if they want to go eat to a new restaurant they don t expext me to pay for them so i don t get they idea that someone has to pay for your meal
731,not a fan of the re uploads,,russell let him answer lol ffs,no this will not have any effect because voltage current resistance therefore 3 i 1000 naturally human body resistance is around few thousand ohms current i 0 003 amp conclusively this level of current wont effect on our body,submit to yeouuw

738,ai wifebots and synthetic will replace women 2030,,i love the combination of you two speaking it s the best,this is one of those things that would be particulary difficult to explain to aliens,noah why is the alpha male podcast in my recommended videos now
739,redpill is just wrong tho,,the reason why the elite are using all their controlled resources like media and education via political control against masculinity is that emasculated feminine men don t pull the increasingly totalitarian elite from their ivory towers as they have in the past,bro you were a couple minutes from my house damn,you re a pretty enlightened human being i hope it rubs off on me a little
740,did you already react to tom macdonald s musics that s would be rich to debate with him,,i think he s thinking about it backwards his message hit so hard because it resonated so strongly with the youtube audience his success is partly because his message went to the exact place it was needed,speak slowly dude,or a lot
741,god bless you sneaki,,peterson brand two beacons of light in an era of darkness,why don t we just fish all those carp into near extinction we ve done it with other fish species usually ones we don t want that to happen to,what the hell is this confrrence full of women being talked down to by a 14 year old given a microphone talking about the double standard of well if you make a man pay for the meal then you deserve to be r ped ok have fun in prison
742,ayeeee hes back,,that statistic about more men then woman on youtube is complete rubbish why would he think that it s not easily debunked what a con artist,10 million views on a tom scott video,very good very nice
743,i understand u live in new york however i want to know what u think about lizz truss the new prime minister,,jp is one of the most intelligent idiots of modern times,actually closing canal would give more jobs to truckers government are idiots believe me i m a military veteran and our country is going down toilet fast love of money root of all evil god,this is literally advice for self sabotage for empathy is one of the most important qualities and strengths a human being can show
744,aren t you coping with the fact your girl gets fucked by other guys,,so true children are very impressionable and gullible and we take everything our parents do say and teach us to be the absolute truth without question the way we are raised as children greatly affects how we act and view the world when we become adults most parents are young people in their 20 s who dont realy know how to raise a child except for their own personal experiences with their parents to guide them many of us blame our parents for the way we are but when we become a little older we realise that their is no one to blame for our own ignorance except ourselves learn from it and try to do better with our own children,while this video is great it doesn t mention a huge issue which is mis identifying common carp naturalized in the us and buffalo similar to a carp native to the us and extremely similar to carp as the serious invasive species of silver carp or bighead carp this has caused a witchhunt for these mostly harmless species simply because they are carp as well so many people will just kill any carp they come across because they think any carp is invasive and its terrible when this occurs in that sense while the video is great for calling out this issue of asian carp in these waters i think you should ve said something specifying that there is this other issue as well as i can guarantee that people will see this video and further be influenced to believe all carp are the issue and catch and kill them which is just not correct so please on the chance that you catch a carp please know that if its not an asian or bighead carp there is absolutely 0 reason to kill it in fact its best to release them as they are incredibly fun to catch and don t hurt the ecosystem at all,the random arab aunty morning pics were so random
745,take accountability most of your content is a reaction streams too,,and yet socially who is winning groups or individuals yeah there s strength in groups never forget that the point of the individual like christ is that he can transcend the tendencies of the group and set a new path for groups but what happened to the individual himself he got tortured ridiculed placed on a cross and murdered it wasn t until much later that his individual message became transcendent thanks to people picking it up and sharing it to groups now if you want to argue metaphysically christ s transcendence comes from redeeming humanity sure but i was talking pragmatically here on earth,so fish now need to carry i d to swim in any water fish can now be pulled over just for looing like an asian carp fish profiling wow,if i were to ever have a girlfriend which i wont because i am gay i would definitely talk to her about politics and serious topics with her consent of course because that s what i m interested in
746,we need the heat,,straight men have never been responsible for the gorgeous women in advertising and the unattainable body images in mannequins etc gay men and women run fashion and advertising departments,here s your tax money,yes quote that bell hooks
747,we live in a soy society,,i disagree ursula and some others peterson mentioned are the wise old crone archetype who teaches the life death life cycle they teach that in order for some things to grow others have to be sacrificed its the spirit of the earth sure mother gaia but not in the over protective ways he alludes to check out women who run with the wolves if you d like to learn more,drinkinggamesuggestion take a shot every time someone says barrier,18 36 i ve never seen a more profound sadness in someone s eyes before
748,beating off to porn lowers your testosterone too,,and bambi clearly the devouring mother but don t worry he ll have a rationalization for that too because in no event can it not be the devouring mother if that s the context chosen for the instant argument peterson is a doublethink jedi root to stem he says a whole lot that is correct on a factual or study level and then uses it to subvert and has mastered the art of attempting to rhetorically justify espousing contradictory positions simultaneously he has an agenda while pretending not to and it s unfortunate because he could do better and because pretending to be objective to hide not being objective is a special kind of dishonesty,you d think they would drain the canals,i love your videos so much in a clearly empath goofball kind of way 3
749,we wanna see the miami home boyyyyy,,hey russell died his hair,and put legs on the barges,the empath arc hahaha noah i frickin love you
750,jesus is the only answer,,the jordan peterson can so clearly describe the masculine and it s importance for both men and women was super insightful liked russell s calling out the worship of the feminine due to absence of spirituality that s deep,someone could just take a few carp and release them into the great lakes too,should always be a split i m not your dad lol
751,christ is lord,,i never pictured russell as a thinker until recently you have my respect sir,should use the same technique in the rio grande to combat illegals from crossing,the answer to the who should pay question is whoever asked to go on the date if i asked you out i should be expected to pay
752,what would you say if someone didn t believe in jesus,,i think reason why ouens are watching more youtube videos is because they are searching for a proper pathway to masculinity in other words they are looking for a proper role model in how to be a man reason being there aren t good male role models,nah rather shouldn t,i think i have the perfect answer for the who should pay for the date question who proposed the date if it s your idea you pay for it i remember many times in my younger and poorer days asking a friend if they wanted to go grab lunch or dinner and them responding with i can t afford it my response was always i didn t ask if you can afford it i asked if you wanted to the man generally plans the first date in heterosexual relationships so yeah they should be expected to pay don t invite someone on an 1 on 1 excursion unless you plan on footing the bill it s about spending time with them don t make them consider finances when considering hanging out with you
753,amen seek and you will find,,hard to see why they banned some of jordans content,we just don t learn about not taking species out of their natural environment and putting them where they don t belong do we,cis hetero normative holy fuck man
754,stop using the allahu akbar meme yiu racist skinny little white boy,,nonsense the fairy god mother used magic to give everything to cinderella i could make up supposed correlations between the male and female and disney movies much more insightful than this peterson is no philosopher for sure,holy mackerel i sure didn t expect to see him in my city this video i guess important people just roll on through without much of a fuss anymore,it s accurate i know it s sounds cringe but it is often the truth
755,stop drinking redbull bro,,anyone who knows what the word substrate means and doesn t have the capacity to use another more common word to describe his point of view is a poser plain and simple,are they tasty,big words scary waaahhhh
756,try watching at 1 5 boys it s pure schizophrenia,,there s no place for the divine feminine in the holy trinity me father son holy ghost man woman child i really don t think this man looked into this some people consider the holy ghost to be feminine,giant tesla coil attached to a speedboat ultracap bank,i m struggling to see the problem
757,glad you back sneako,,its fabulous to be listening to an intelligent conversation even if it had sleeping beauty and the little mermaid as talking points,would this work in the rio grande river we have an invasive species coming across that river as well,i think it makes the most sense for the person who asked to go on a date to also be the one to pay on a first date of course you can still decide to do it differently nothing wrong with splitting the bill either
758,return of the menace,,to me the difference between jp and rb is jp first and foremost has his eye on his image and retaining his identity as an authority in the intellectual field whereas rb first and foremost is interested in expanding and exploring the ideas in the discussion itself so its uncomfortable for me to see rb seek jp s judgement on his ideas as he is asking someone who is inferior to him in the development of ideas imo this is from quite a while ago i think but rb please rather look up to people who are open hearted as their guiding principle in conversation not guarding a brittle self identification with intellect,dredge the whole river and export the carp meat to china they are having food shortages,red pill in a nutshell got hurt by a girl and rationalise it with toxicity narcissism and lack of self reflection then believe that they ve found the secret to all women black pill in a nutshell keeps getting rejected by women for utter lack of self awareness and or personal hygiene grooming and blames the world for being short and or ugly tired of these clowns
759,guess who s back back again shneako s back tell a friend,,no no how can you listen too this guy can t you see he s a bigot,ah yes but their suffering makes the us look stronger,to be fair you can t deny that ugly people are treated horribly and are seen in a more negative way no matter what they do it s a bias that most if not all humans have they deserve empathy synpathy and deserve to be heard unless of course they start lashing out like most incels or at least a very vocal fraction of them do
760,found you through patrick cc s documentary you re unafraid to speak your mind and you re a great entertainer keep spreading the truth bro,,uhmmm two smart dudes discussing sleeping beauty and the little mermaid awesome,this is really cool thanks tom,just got my favorite moment of the day the first video of this guy played where he said something like if a woman cant completely submit to you and my phone slipped in my hand so i accidentally clicked on some random video that i must have started watching at some and it started playing somewhere in the middle with the amazingly fitting sentence and this might be the reason why you re still single im dead
761,patrick s content is awesome,,peterson is saying problems arise when we don t invite in make space for the devouring mother crone witch feminine chaos whatever you want to call it i e sleeping beauty ends up unconscious based on the myth he s referencing if the devouring mother is a problem in our society is this not evidence that something might be lacking an invitation maybe peterson spends his time advocating against the overmothering behaviors archetype yeah dude duh maleficent is powerful and vengeful and scary we know he also acknowledges the feminine has both positive and negative arcs i e fairy godmother and evil witch so what would have happened if sleeping beauty s parents apologized to maleficent and invited her to the next party what if we advocated for the witch to be invited in the first place so we don t spend the rest of the movie aka our lives fighting oh right because we love the drama of it all it wouldn t be a good movie if we didn t have a bad villain in real life if we want meaningful change we have to stop making villains out of each other it seems to me peterson would rather keep making his point overmothering is bad rather than thoughtfully engage with the devouring mother herself if i were having an intimate conversation with peterson myself i would ask him what if you actually love being devisive and controversial what if you truly enjoy getting strong reactions from people by belabouring emotional difficult topics with evasive and academic language what if you accepted you are really good at doing just that and what if that is a totally normal and amazing phenomenon and what would happen if we observed it and savored it and used in a cooler more effective way why deny the drama you bring it with you everywhere,i m curious how electricity doesn t just go to ground impure water is a good conductor and any electric currents have a huge ground available at low resistance i find this explanation rather hard to believe,i feel like all these redpill dudes are serial cheaters and domestic abusers
762,what doc umentary,,russell could you interview dr david martin he is the fact man you really need on all of your sides right now goggle exclusive dr david martin ends covid 19 this is just sad when the justice system has failed us all been watching him since he started this checked all his work and is all true and as you know i am pro truth,life uh finds a way,please let them expose themselves so that emotionally grounded people can dodge them
763,sneako s haters create his new fans everyday lmao,,you can be good just because you choose to,i grew up in a part of new jersey that usually only had carp and catfish in the sixties the carp didn t drive out the native species pollution did the carp merely managed to survive more pollution than did bass when the eco revolution came and waters were improved the other fish returned it s easy to blame the carp that doesn t make it correct,9 10 no bisexual lighting
764,sneako could take out five of them with a left hook,,i m a woman love youtube love men thank god we aren t all female i have 3 amazing sons am so proud of how they are maturing we have different strengths weaknesses need each other healthy partnerships can be beautiful,another thing to consider those carp are not the same as in this video there has yet to be any asian carp in nj to my knowledge the ones in your state are naturalized common carp and are no immediate threat but they do survive well in pollution so you are totally correct,noah went outside just to flex the arc teryx
765,i m going to the shop anyone want anything,,the divine male and sacred feminine seem to be missing in our modern world,they couldn t just put up a fence under the water they had to invest in electrocution efforts to be put in place instead seems drastic also how is poisoning the water ok how do they not see that this seeps into other waterways,in the relationship the person that cares more is always at a disadvantage that person is going to be used be her partner simply because the other one cares less the real question is how to make the other person care more the man should be attractive to get attention from other women so his girl should be always afraid he might leave for better hotter younger gal it is called the dread game and it is mostly passive you don t hit on every waitress at the restaurant it is actually desperate behavior you have to be attractive enough the other women will give you the look
766,if they ban sneako i ll walk in his stead,,that s not true that the youtube audience is all male and yes they do use sexuality in commercial advertising the mans hot body and the females hot body sex sells duh harry potter is the most demonic movie books ever written it s not safe to have children even read harry potter those are all real spells in that book witches and demons no no no this jordan guy is dangerous,the ships would destroy the fence poisoning the water isn t ok of course,this assumes that relationships must be zero sum and transactional which reflects more about you than people in general
767,bro i love how you just spit facts and all the lib s freak tf out,,thank you for addressing that there is a very masculine element to jordan peterson i ve always thought so too also i m a woman and i m ok with you being you as always intelligent interesting and important,invasive asian carp are a serious problem and i sure hope we can keep them out of the great lakes i m not feeling hopeful though,_ even when you re in a relationship you must play this silly mind game _ your existence feels exhausting
768,i didn t know arms could talk im joking lol,,brain food,in order to cross this body of water you need a freaking room on the boat to not get hit in the head,is he recording behind an elementary school well you blue pill guys do like children s schools
769,let s gooooo,,russell is kinda hot,thats really just kinda evil leave nature alone,meanwhile in any given incel redpill community it s natural for men to want to date much younger girls
770,men are becoming women women are turning masculine temperaments are changing and making adolescents more confused by day don t give your kid the media they ll change for the worse,,russel thank you for staying yourself and sharing such interesting conversations i love hearing you think out loud so smartly and humbly i hope to meet you one day and chat,close it down its not worth it,you think alphas actually exist don t you
771,fck sneako hurry up,,it s nice to hear people freely debating their ideas beliefs without disowning each other forever or being kicked off of social media everyone is entitled to their ideas and opinions and everyone deserves to be peacefully heard thank you,so if the power goes out,this comment says a lot about you
772,bruh you got banned why though,,hello how are you,it s all fun and games until the government shows up at your house,ask a dutch crowd who should pay and the answer is both the men and the woman get out a calculator and ask the waiter to split the bill into exactly who ate what
773,cuz he spittin truth,,masculinity and femininity are not related to gender in jungian terms it might more easily be digested as yang and yin however indeed the terms are muddled as we are all children of patriarchy so what does masculine and feminine mean from this cultural context a delightful exchange about the archetypes in fairytales,get a fishing strategy in place to catch some carp they would easily feed a poor family,the memes in the intro is extra punny if you speak arabic
774,my nigga free,,i find jordan peterson to be a creep and a weirdo,gotta do what the austrillians did with the emus just put a bounty on carps and jimbob and his buddy dan will solve all your issues albeit a bit of dynamite might be involved,14 45 the guys speak truth women are the gatekeepers of _box_ and men are the gatekeepers of commitment any decent looking woman can have fun with virtually any guy she meets the guys are mostly rejected that is why we respect men who have the skill to _game_ multiple women and we don t respect women who were with many men bc for girls it requires no skill the real chellange for girls is not getting _box_ but getting relations high value man is most likely happy to score but he is not willing to offer the commitment the true man s power in the dating scene comes from offering the ring which they should never offer in the current legal system divorce law
775,lets gooooo,,blech can t stand that egotistical dude,why don t they come up with a permanent solution like sterilizing the water ways repopulating with native species,these kind of sentiments are only valid if the women in question want to conform to traditional values and gender roles which is why such advice leaves so many redpill guys even more frustrated when they still do not find success bc all the logic and science used to support the redpill draws conclusions based on rigid assumptions about traditional values and gender roles often resulting in the redpill talking points drive young men towards even more radical and extreme ideology so a good example why the redpill ideology is not effective
