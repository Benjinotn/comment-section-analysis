0,id take a boat out there with a bbq and wait for one to volunteer to be my dinner,1,1
1,can birds not carry their eggs to the other side,2,2
2,they tried this with velociraptors,1,0
3,i like to see guys using 12ga shotguns on these jumping fish,4,1
4,human intervention does harm let s intervene,5,1
5,fish zzzz people xp,1,1
6,i m glad that the military is being deployed to combat the country s real enemy fish,5,1
7,i don t understand why they incompacitate them instead of kill them if they re invasive then what s the problem is it animal rights,1,2
8,god bless america,5,1
9,why won t they use fish nets i know problem is more complex but it could be used in more effective ways much much cheaper than electric power house,2,2
10,how does it stun the fish but kill a person,4,2
11,they should add a huge dry dock and recycle the water they use to fill and empty it,4,2
12,they playing real life tower defense out here,5,1
13,turn up the volts and kill them they will get in it s not like we want them just like the hogs in the south,3,2
14,when he was talking about the different defenses they were looking into i was like well dont make it public the fish will find out then realized im stupid,1,2
15,mao and the sparrows damn no one studies history anymore,1,1
16,power outage enters chat,4,1
17,this guy is bluepilled,1,0
18,that is not taking evolution in consideration in a few generations there will be electrician carps neutralizing this barrier,3,0
19,sadly they will end up making it into the great lakes an entire run of rivers and canals decimated for other native fish because of humans,2,2
20,be thankful aliens haven t decided humans are like these carp an ecological disaster,1,1
21,they are already in the great lakes i worked on lake erie for years and they were there the bigger problem is the fact that detroit and various other industrial city s dumping toxic material into the lake causing massive dead zones,2,2
22,a few weeks ago there was a silver carp that got shoked by the dnr above the electric gate not saying they are taking over but it may happen if more get through,2,2
23,they should add some sharks to the rivers i m sure that won t cause any long term issues,3,2
24,spinosate box wormdead,3,1
25,spinosate carp in mississippi,3,1
26,need to electrify the rio grande asap,3,0
27,obviously great pains are made to negate the human interference of introducing the carp this too seems like great costly pains,1,2
28,hello rio grande,5,0
29,if asian carp was more like halibut or even cod there would be no problem at all,3,2
30,tow a light low wide barge behind the a fast boat and all those fish will just jump in,5,2
31,they should shut the canal off completely the risk reward is way too heavy on the risk side,2,2
32,gotta start eating them,5,1
33,and what bout fishes,5,1
34,cool but with how close it s been already i feel like it s going to happen eventually,3,2
35,they should use big long nets also string them across the river in a few different places,3,2
36,there is no possible way to kill off these fish now that they have been introduced right so from now to eternity we will have to do things like electric barriers because people couldn t just keep their hands off nature and not introduce an invasive species,5,2
37,what if instead we utilize how they jump out of water from being startled,3,2
38,it will be some pud fisherman with a bucket full of canal minnows for bait to fish lake superior that s going to get this environmental disaster started at the end of a days fishing what s left in the bucket gets tossed into the lake and were off to the races mark my words its not if they get into the great lakes its when and it will happen,1,2
39,im from peoria and i didn t know this,1,0
40,broski are you meaning to say trucks are worse for the enviorment then a few fish,1,1
41,that s what we need at border with higher output,3,0
42,why not place a bounty on the carp and use fishing licence taxes and other funds to fund the bounty per fish amazing how fast something can be wiped out or at least reduced to a more manageable level when money is involved,1,2
43,they really should just close the canal most of these goods can be loaded on rail cars no congestion eventually something will get through and the lakes will be ruined forever,5,2
44,3 32 duck goes under in the background and never resurfaces,1,1
45,simple solution get rid of the fish and free fertilizer build buoys that ride behind the boats that are like 20 feet of putting nets in between them drive the boat up and down the river does the fish jump out of the water they land in the net behind the boat as you see in every video jump from the sides landon the nets you catch hundreds of carbs by driving up and down the river not harsh come on people,4,2
46,why not use giant nets at different positions to prevent the fish from going through and the nets can be used like a opening bridge of sorts when a boat needs to go by doesn t this electrocution thing seem like an overkill,2,2
47,to say it s america im surprised they haven t got snipers watching the river,1,1
48,where can i find this electric water,5,0
49,ya no terrorist thanks just a idea to give people in recreational waters,5,1
50,grew up in the peoria area we would get jet skis and john boats and shoot the carp with shotguns when they jumped out of the water good fun,4,2
51,u can t close it off temporarily,1,1
52,this was so interesting thanks,5,0
53,so anyone can just release two carps in the great lake and kill the industry,1,2
54,bro i know my phone is listening we randomly talked about this is my english class lecture,1,0
55,this is just crazy,1,0
56,electricity resistant carp will make it through,4,1
57,what if i catch some carp and release it into the lakes unless you pay me one million dollars,1,2
58,over fishing is a big problem in other places can t you just over fish the carp,2,2
59,all this effort goes toward a stupid fish but the border is wide open electrify that,2,0
60,as usual this solution along with other deterants that the so called experts come up with did not work either because they were implemented to late or not thought out properly we are finding these carp in the great lakes your corps of engineers have failed again if the truth be known the asian carp is producing a form of income for a lot of americans and that is more important a lot of talk as usual make it sound like your are doing everything that can be done and fooling everyone once again,1,2
61,me on my way to take 15 fish with me to the grand lakes,5,2
62,hey i live there,5,1
63,seems kind of inevitable that carp will end up in the great lakes eventually,3,2
64,survival of the fittest carps win humans need to stop messing around with nature,5,1
65,thanks yet again greatest generation,5,1
66,i can t imagine the energy needed to operate this,3,0
67,please stop saying carps its asian carps common carp have nothing to do with this,1,0
68,us army corp of engineers,4,1
69,they couldn t figure out a lake or a river but we re gonna stop or slow global warming,4,1
70,look at history and the us government has done more to destroy the environment then any evil company,5,1
71,what stops someone from just walking up to the lake with a bunch of carp and letting them free,1,2
72,are a series of nets not an option due to potentially hindering flow because couldn t you have stages of nets that are lowered and raised to allow barges to pass through but there s always a point where at least one is fully up to avoid passage of fish,2,2
73,a very nice video,5,1
74,0 02 weeee,1,1
75,we already have carp in michigan so there s that,3,1
76,i have always wanted to wake surf with a bat and just hit carp for fun,5,1
77,why does the worker guy explaining the use of the fence sound like chills the number fifteen burger king guy,1,2
78,if carp were imported in to cause this whole mess would importing predators of carp be a bad idea,1,2
79,so in order to throw a billion dollar wrench to the economy all one needs are some horny tarps and a trip to the great lakes interesting,3,2
80,why are you wearing flourescent vests,1,1
81,and when the carp were originally introduced i m sure that local scientists all chorused how the carp would solve all their problems and that the science was sound,4,2
82,i just pumped out their septic lmaoooo it s on old romeo road in romeoville illinois,1,1
83,the human mind is curious i think the population would benefit greatly,3,2
84,what happens if some dude just takes a few carp and drives over to great lakes and throws them in,1,2
85,is this dude serious bro cuyahoga river ohio loaded with carp lake erie loaded so all the great lakes are full of carp,1,2
86,lake erie is loaded dude i catch carp there all the time,1,1
87,god forbid those carp get into lake erie and destroy the walleye,1,1
88,ah improving things is again prevented by monetary interests at least i hope that carp is tasty,2,1
89,all of that and any human could just dump thoses fish to ruin everything,1,2
90,did they take the human factor into account however not talking about the barrier right now but about trolls in general people doing it for the lulz like anyone can just take the carp and drop them at the lake no,3,2
91,army corps built the disaster and now is in charge of trying to fix it what s that old axiom the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result,1,2
92,americans doing what americans do best ruined the environment,1,1
93,can t you use the fish animal feed fish cakes since you ve got so much u know life gives you lemons,1,1
94,how can birds go on the water essentially in the water but if a human does it or say treads water they die why,2,2
95,me driving my car in the great lake with a cooler full of pregnant carps,5,1
96,rubidiumhd gaming and blogs close,5,1
97,funny i wonder if barrior works for other invasive species trying to move north build that wall,4,1
98,if 95 percent are carp on that side why don t they wipe out that hole side and start again,2,2
99,bro i gotta wake up for class in 3 hours why am i watching this,1,0
100,ad god did not put those dang fish in north america he did not put permanent elctrified fences either blackout or flooded power systems means it will at some time fail due to natural disasters occurring,1,1
101,what if some one carry that fish to it,1,2
102,maybe this could be used in the rio grande to prevent anyone from crossing into the united states from mexico hmmm,1,0
103,god forbid those carp get into lake erie and destroy the walleye,1,1
104,poor fish didn t escape muricans greed,1,1
105,as a fisherman i really don t want these carp in the great lakes,2,2
106,maybe they should do this at the border,3,0
107,never in my life have i seen fish just jumping in and out the water like that loving life like they re dolphins,5,2
108,how much would it hurt to jump in,2,2
109,they should defiantly do this at the boarder,3,0
110,i love how human intervention causes harm is used as an explanation for why these thriving carp are a bad thing and yet putting an electric fence underwater to direct entire ecosystems of fish at a price tag surely of 10s of millions of dollars per year of taxpayer money likely more is somehow not a human intervention that causes harm who cares if the carp are dominating the ecosystem they look edible to me as far as getting hit in the face by a flying fish i guess you would have to stop going 40 miles an hour down the lake 16 hours a day how tragic imagine all the tubers and water skiers who would be so gravely oppressed by the evil carp were they allowed to roam free and pursue their natural fate and destiny let me guess the author also believes climate change is going to sink florida and england by 2030 the gaslighting never ends the real victims here are people living in the area who have to hear the noise pollution of incessant recreational boating at high speeds and the taxpayers who continue to be robbed deaf by the perpetually expanding inefficient ineffective misdirected largest most profligate corporations on earth known as governments,4,2
111,there are carp in the great lakes i used to catch them in the 70 s,4,2
112,so someone could just take a carp and bring it to the lakes and everyone is screwed,1,2
113,in 10 years we ll have electrical carp zapping everything,5,1
114,we could ensure the safety of the largest freshwater lakes on the planet but money so we won t,2,2
115,whats wrong with carp it is tasty,3,1
116,how about a net,5,1
117,import predators too,5,1
118,toxins scientists wonder why so many sea animals are dead on beaches,1,1
119,it s the great lakes not ocean smart guy,3,2
120,what s up broski,5,1
121,why not,1,1
122,i never heard of this before now thanks for sharing this,5,0
123,magikarp has evolved into an even more annoying fish,1,1
124,well a bird could catch a fish and accidentally release it on the other side of the barrier,4,2
125,more pollution resulting from closing the canal is idiotic electrified trains can easily replace the barges the only problem is is that the billionaire corporations are unwilling to invest in the electrical infrastructure along the existing freight rail lines barges cause both air pollution and water pollution,2,2
126,how does this stop someone from catching 20 karp from the river and dumping them into the lake,5,0
127,at one point americans will learn this fence did more damage and created a new set of problems quick fix economy,2,1
128,why don t fish get harmed but humans do,1,1
129,stray electric currents can destroy boat props and axles how far away do you need to keep your boat to not have to worry about it,5,0
130,i caught a huge carp in lake superior 25 years ago,5,1
131,co2 would create dead zones making a lock system in conjunction with electricity would be probably more efficient,3,1
132,pokemon please remove electric weakness from bird pokemon,1,1
133,did you just say carp have no natural predators where s my rod i ll show you,3,1
134,ahh yes the us army vs fish,1,1
135,hi i m johnny knoxville and this is the thrilling dive ooohhhhhhhhh,5,0
136,what if a jokester terrorist took like 10 of these and throw them in lake michigan or whatever,1,1
137,i would enlarge that canal and make sure it extends fully to the mississippi it needs to become a major trade route again chicago will prosper from this and the city needs something to stimulate its economy to break the cycle of extreme crime and poverty,3,2
138,need this on the southern boarder rio grande,5,0
139,let the people fish for free on carps no limits,5,1
140,aren t these fish edible,1,1
141,don t know too many people that would want to go kayaking or canoeing on the sanitary canal it s anything but sanitary,3,2
142,this should be a reminder of the law of unintended consequences that should be considered before we start scrubbing co2 out of the atmosphere,3,2
143,intervention the key word we will see the same effect with the immun systems from the vaxxed,4,2
144,what about a bird picking up the fish and dropping it on the other side i am not an engineer but i just figured that one out haha,1,2
145,also are you using the mac or pc version,5,1
146,this is ridiculous not the solution but that humans put themselves into this position,1,0
147,it bought time thats it lake ontario is polluted with carp now,1,1
148,i wonder if they put a 1 4 of a mile of some sort of gas like carbon monoxide or whatever is harmful to the fish in the mouth of the canal on grids would do any good,2,2
149,while carp is not considered a normally eaten fish there are some parts of the world especially asia that actually like them a huge source of income is being wasted by not pursuing this idea by placing nets across the canal before the fish get close to the electrified ares would allow for quick and easy capture much like normal commercial fishing is done placed in normal containers for shipping fish and the population could at least be brought down a lot,2,2
150,it s utterly stupid,1,1
151,this is interesting so without human would this have been a problem at all or would it have devastated the local wildlife horribly,3,0
152,can i charge my tesla in this water,5,0
153,nothing would be more valuable than keeping the carp out not shipping not the barges being able to run nothing should outweigh the decision to shut off that canal,1,2
154,can t there be a few electric meshes at certain distances across the width only at times of boats passing they can be down and pulses used then,3,2
155,this is dumb as hell and should be deemed illegal absolutely disgusting,1,0
156,spoken like someone who doesn t understand the concept of an invasive species and how they decimate local wildlife,1,2
157,army always kill so i suppose it s to kill the fish,3,2
158,that s a ton of crap oh sorry carp i mean,1,1
159,not sure why electricity under water what is wrong with multiple layers of nets under water this seems to me much easier and cheaper than electricity,3,0
160,should just release piranhas to kill the carp trust me im a human,1,1
161,my question is will birds not eventually carry them their young or eggs upstream eventually anyways,2,1
162,what do they do with all the dead fish,5,2
163,i mean only a lightly motivated individual could just pick up fish from one side and just drop it on the other side some ecological terrorist could devastate the great lakes,2,2
164,do you think they could add a couple bubble fences as well,3,1
165,i really want to drop some carp in the great lakes now,3,2
166,oddly canada does it to prevent their citizens from leaving,3,1
167,on my way to buy 5 carps and throw them in the lake,5,2
168,small fish illegally immigrate past the barrier by hiding between barges,1,1
169,abit over the top and sad to just stop a few fish while endangering human life,2,2
170,relaxing swim it seems,3,1
171,i hope no one takes a bunch of carp from the river and drop it in the lake deliberately,1,2
172,what happens when there is power outage,5,1
173,thought maybe the electiric fence will create a bottle neck collect so many fish and then all of a sudden you guys have a bird problem and that sucks worse,2,2
174,why do they jump,1,1
175,it is not a vital waterway those barges move very few goods compared with big rivers gov t is stupid close it down get commerial fisherman in there to catch them and make fertilizer out of them and i understand they are edible and not that bad we learned this 200 years ago when we brought the common carp here now they re all over thanks a lot arkansas,2,2
176,i disagree with the concept of invasive with regards to wildlife let nature be nature it wouldn t be what it is today if every invasive species was contained for millions of years you aren t meant to freeze a global ecosystem in place that is not organic now invasive humans on the other hand,2,2
177,haven t you done a video on this before,5,0
178,just let in eu fishermen and there won t be any fish to electrify in like 2 3 years,1,2
179,as an ichthyologist i study fish i don t particularly like the electric gates carp get huge and are very resistant the carp will most likely get by and other fish that migrate between the rivers and the lakes get immediately killed ontop of this all this carp exist on the other side give it 30 years and they will decimate the lower great lakes i don t know what to do about carp it s quite terrifying as they can survive in as little as 3 feet of water because they use a method of feeding by lifting up the ground and filtering for food absolutely ruining all plants and destroying ecosystems carp are some of my favorite fish regardless,4,2
180,are they resistant to electricity the video seems to imply that the larger something is the more likely it is to be effective probably because the voltage is applied to an area their concern is that very small fish can make it through but not larger fish,3,2
181,thanks tom for coming over to my home city,5,1
182,they couldn t get you a reflective vest that fit,2,1
183,ignorant people always do ignorant things they should have known what would happen with the carp if they had any intelligence,1,2
184,amd them some dude puts a couple in some buckets drives to the new lake and just sets them free,3,2
185,introducing few tons of big mouth bass they will destroy carp frys in no time,5,1
186,this video alone has me tempted to relocate about a dozen carp into the great lakes,5,0
187,answer money,5,1
188,do these fish die after being shocked why not just open fishing season,1,1
189,what is the price tag of this bs,5,0
190,the carp have completely destroyed the ohio tennessee cumberland mississippi and missouri river water sheds it s a complete tragedy what has happened to the midwest just so some fish farms could keep the stock ponds clean american business model at its finest,1,2
191,as an european i wish we had this much fish in our rivers and lakes also here this kind of carp is quite popular on fish farms so people would be happy if price went down by at lease half or if fishermen had something to fish to begin with,4,2
192,what is the saying nature finds a way great lakes are doomed,1,1
193,i grew up and live in south florida where the invasive pythons are destroying the everglades by literally eating all of the native birds and animals etc sadly there strong speculation that someone released their pet python into the ecosystem at on point unleashing this disaster i have vacationed on the great lakes michigan and superior with my family and both lakes are magnificent my real fear is some deranged individual in some form of ecoterrorism is going to intentionally release carp into the great lakes which will make this system null and void i pray it never happens but into todays world sadly nothing surprises me anymore,2,2
194,bioengineer the carp,5,1
195,wait so i can take 100 carp fish and put them in the lake and kill a huge industry,1,2
196,no gyarados,1,1
197,firstly honored tom came to my homeland secondly i knew nothing about this electrified fish barrier only a quick drive from my home,5,0
198,all over the world water problems umericans lets do 10km toxic into the water,1,2
199,human intervention causes more harm we ve electrified this canal,5,0
200,what are the ecological costs from the power required to electrify this barrier,5,0
201,forget the fish they need electrified water at the mexico border zzzzzzzzzzzzz,1,2
202,surely it would have been easier cheaper and more effective to just block that canal physically and cut it off from the lakes talk about over engineering a solution,2,2
203,anyone else thought it was to keep mexicans out lmaoo,1,1
204,what s to stop them from walking or getting a ride up idiots they are already in there someone has already dumped them off in there,1,2
205,that s great now go eradicate the karp already,5,1
206,we are going through the beginning of the energy crisis and the us are electrifying large bodies of water just have a fishing completions or some bollovks,4,2
207,what s wrong with carp as a food source,1,1
208,this feels overengineered,2,0
209,can they not capture the carp for food wouldn t take long to make it extinct,2,2
210,we would be its natural predator and we just need to figure out how to make it edible with its bones we could also use it for animal feed and fertilizer,3,2
211,i recently got a direct hit to the shin by a silver carp this past weekend it hurts a lot,2,0
212,and all this work and money could be undone by one person dropping a carp in to the great lake,5,2
213,the carp look like good eating,4,1
214,freddy oh god hey these things don t leak do they frank leak hell no these things were made by the u s army corps of engineers,1,1
215,what about birds spreading eggs about easily done,2,1
216,great video very informative i hope the carp never reach the great lakes that would be a disaster for the native fish,5,2
217,design newer barges that can transfer their load via a docking station to another waiting barge on the opposite side,4,1
218,install this in the rio grande,5,0
219,so if a bird accidentally drops a carp upstream before killing it this would all be for nothing,1,0
220,can i drink it,3,1
221,i think there was a dirty jobs episode on this many years ago,1,1
222,who will win the barrier vs one memer releasing some carps on the other side this is in no way a permanent solution,1,2
223,i was expecting some large bodies of electrified carp floating amidst the river i left disappointed i m hungry,2,1
224,seriously they use thousands of taxpayers dollars for something that can be achieved by encouraging local fishermen to hunt them into extinction if there s anything humans know how to do it s cause the extinction of a species,1,2
225,i just pictured aquaman down there saying look an enemy vehicle approaches quick throw these fish at them,1,1
226,i know this is off topic but i just rickrolled by n ad,1,0
227,i love how at the start a fish just launched into the air,5,2
228,just put a net in there,4,1
229,he s out of breath,1,1
230,ya wanna see those carp disappear pay people 1 for each carp they catch they ll be extinct in a decade,1,1
231,we re starting to find asian carp in the scioto river this year in central ohio clearly this isn t working 100,1,0
232,easy solution release great white sharks into that bish,5,1
233,of course they did no limit to human stupidity,1,1
234,anyone else remined of super mario sunshine here,5,1
235,just what we need on the rio grande stops invasive species,5,0
236,couldn t they do it during covid 19 lockdown traffic was lower so car and traffic jam wasn t the issue anymore,1,1
237,love your videos,5,1
238,carp are in lake superior,4,1
239,it s to keep me out,3,1
240,hey bud your in the fuckin usa we don t size up fish in kgs we use lbs,1,1
241,organize a competition of best carb rescipe and let people fish them freely at the very lease get them minced up and use it for animal feed human will drive it to extinction,5,2
242,now this video is up your bound to have at least 1 kid go fishing for 2 carps and then dump them the other side just for the fun of it,5,2
243,that s not the army,1,2
244,so why is it the army not the marine doing this why do people doing this need to know how to use weapons navigate war,1,0
245,carps are tasty af,3,1
246,7 bill fish 16 bill usd boat industry,1,1
247,idea how about a lock where after its closed you put toxin in keep it for a while then filter it out again and open it on the other side or is it not possible to filter out toxin,2,2
248,on this scale its defnitly not easy to fully filter out toxin even the smallest rudiments could accumulate and cause ecological damage downstream,2,1
249,what s stopping bird from picking up the carps and dropping them on the other side,1,2
250,the fools on here are stating the fish cannot get through this chokehold due to electrified water as a train goes right past only 50 ft away did you get a close look at the engineer on the train that passed slow it down and look again not gonna rat em out but that engineer was lookin green in the gills that s all i m sayin stupid they think they stopped the carp,1,2
251,honestly with the weaknesses of this barrier i think it s likely that there is a carp population in the lake already it just hasn t gotten to the fast part of exponential growth yet,3,2
252,i give up the usa is just hopeless,1,1
253,i thought fish eggs could attach to birds,3,1
254,those fishes could feed millions of people,1,1
255,if all it takes is 2 small fish to get through which apparently can this is a multi million dollar delaying tactic nothing more wow,1,0
256,talking about invasive species these people who electrify and electrocute the fish are invasive species themselves up north as an invasive species they had the nerve to nail the tongue of the indigenous species offspring to the table simply because they refused to speak the invasive species language i can really see the destruction of the ecosystem such an irony some people should really take a hard look in the mirror,1,2
257,block the canal build a crain lift belt like a lifting bridge but different that lifts taxis the barges over the wall,2,2
258,why do you think there is a flow in the canal its a river which means damming it,1,1
259,just put nets it is not like they re dinosaurs,2,2
260,the way to stop it is to purge the entire river width for 50 or so yards with nitrogen the nitrogen will displace all oxygen in the water and the fish will not enter the 50 yard zone for lack of o2 simple no harmful pollutants and easy to pull off by the way the illinois river also drains into the mississippi,1,2
261,shout out to peoria,1,1
262,i don t care because it s funny,3,1
263,it makes you wonder if something similar could be used off beaches to prevent shark attacks obviously safety would need to be ensured i have thoughts on how but smarter people than me i am sure could come up with a safe and effective method,4,2
264,if they can place toxins in the water to kill all fish and there are no long lasting effects they should use this technique to eliminate every last carp they they can reintroduce the native species of fish and put things right again,2,2
265,why not let people fish them more than usual the carp market would go down but hell you got you some fish outa your lakes,2,2
266,makes you laugh they want folks to lessen their power consumption all whilst using loads to solve problems they made humans an animal that got worse pretending it s not an animal,1,1
267,have you thought about a net,3,1
268,i feel like a dam and fish ladder would be easier,3,2
269,pc to an external monitor and i m watcnice tutorialng tnice tutorials video on one screen and working through exactly what michael is doing and it is a big,5,1
270,why is carp such a funny word,5,1
271,what i dont understand is how this is harmful other things lived there now carp do natural selection,1,0
272,so the billions of dollars would be wasted on someone ignorant enough to just up and dump some live carp into the great lakes then huh,2,2
273,are they not ediable,2,1
274,do the us army core of engineers not wear uniforms are they part of the regular army,1,2
275,everyone minding their own business and having a normal conversation me a complete stranger wanting to listen to what they re saying 0 03,1,1
276,tom should swim in it,3,1
277,what about fish eggs carried by birds,3,1
278,just let the chinese take care of the problem,4,2
279,there are millions of dollars of goods that traverse just through this area alone he says as a freight train goes through that could carry the same goods,1,1
280,just put this on the border problem solved,5,0
281,wait speed hump hahahah,1,1
282,would harvesting carp for fertilizer work,4,1
283,leave it to the government to create a problem that only they can fix but in the end exacerbates the situation thus requiring more taxpayer dollars and more liberties encroached upon,2,2
284,this make the cheep cheep fish from mario games look like an understatement,1,0
285,power failure ecological disaster,1,1
286,i am sorry to say this but this kind of solution will fail sooner or later nature can not be contained,1,0
287,imagine being in the wild and seeing a water source and then you get zapped,5,2
288,so you re saying i should let my pet fish go free on the lake side of that project you know somebody is going to do the unthinkable just a matter of time billy what happened to those fish i had we freed them daddy free,1,2
289,now i know how to gurantee my death jump in that water,5,1
290,animation studios after watching this write that down write that down tbh i also feel like it would make a great plot for a animated movie like what if a baby fish escaped from there and born on a complety different river but can t go past the barrier,2,2
291,this water will electrify and kill you shows seagulls landing on water,5,0
292,will the eggs of those fish also get electrocuted,1,2
293,6 27 sure we know the best thing to do is close the false waterway we created but we re too greedy to worry about that there s money to be made and we want to drive mercedes benz,3,2
294,carpe carpe seize the fish,1,1
295,how are the carp easily startled if they have no predators,3,2
296,what if someone brings carp in a car past it,1,1
297,youtube needs to recommend more educational and informative videos like this to everyone although this particular one would not relate to audiences across the board but the human mind is curious i think the population would benefit greatly,3,2
298,why can t they simply use a big net,1,1
299,carp have taken out many natural aust freshwater fish types amazing to see the infrastructure tasks the us army engineers have completed,5,1
300,six point zero,1,1
301,i still don t understand how it works and why birds can touch the water,3,2
302,we have carp bottom feeders in pennsylvania clarion river for sure and the lakes let s hope there are none but i doubt there isn t,3,2
303,i ll have fish and a rice cake then i ll have me fish,3,1
304,are they not eatable make a business out of it or ask the chinese they know how to outfish the oceans,1,2
305,catch and export,5,1
306,i don t know why they don t offer bounties for the fish and allow those of us who love fishing a way to make money fishing,2,2
307,why dont they just over fish that specific area and lower the carps population,2,2
308,so much for selling the asian carp at a buck each,5,1
309,dude this is nothing our polish government dumped mercury into odra river how _metal_ is that,1,0
310,human civilization is most dangerous thing to earth ever,1,1
311,because they want hunt the fishes,4,2
312,more human intervention causing irreversible damage to our ecosystems surprise surprise,1,1
313,i sure hope they don t collectively evolve into guaradoses,3,1
314,how they cleaned dead fish,5,1
315,we love chicago,5,1
316,why won t a net work,1,1
317,great job bringing more attention to this issue as always,5,0
318,i wonder what their plans are if this is no longer going to work cause you know they have contingency plans and they re probably very extreme,2,1
319,what if the power goes off its bound to happen sometime,2,1
320,why don t they trawl the waters dry of fish with large nets,1,2
321,whats to prevent joe blow to drop some fish into the great lake,3,2
322,this may sound like a dumb idea but is it not possible to find another species to hunt the carp or would it not be possible to literally dredge and clean the waters somehow,2,2
323,you re gonna kill birds too,5,1
324,why not catch them in giant nets and use them as the much needed fertilizer in our farming industry large cranes on each sid of the canal could lower their nets until full of fish then raise the catch and swing the haul to one side to be loaded into waiting trailers for delivery to the fertilizer plant where they would be initially processed through large chippers similar to wood chippers in a papermill then slurried into a drying and packaging plant the initial investment would be huge but the profits would be enormous considering what fertilizer cost these days many large farms would probably accept the slurry in tankers to be directly applied to their acreage back at the canal you would need several locations along the canal to insure while one net is being harvested another one upstream or down straem would be ready to catch the fish if a vessel needs passage the nets could be raised in turn to allow it access,2,2
325,i did a major report on this for a senior research project for my civil and environmental engineering degree it the carp make it into lake michigan it would be absolutely an disaster and devastate the great lakes fisheries,1,2
326,hey tom can you tell me when this footage with the boat passing through beginning at about the 4 00 mark was filmed would like to know if it was my husband at the helm thanks for the information i always hear about the fish barrier but never knew details be safe,3,0
327,you should ask him somewhere he ll more likely see it,3,1
328,disturbing nature,1,1
329,would a curtain of oxygen bubbles not hold the fish back just a thought,1,2
330,bruh jackson ms has like flint mi has a serious crisis still they have growing critical issues with access to clean water and the ms army national guard is currently occupying their municipal water systems to hopefully clear debris and get water to the mississippians who have been told to shower with the toxic water with their mouths closed they are living without clean water to wash cook or flush toilets,2,2
331,don t swim in that water,1,1
332,are they not edible to humans and what about bringing in more fish eating birds to balance the situation naturally,2,2
333,this problem was caused by introducing a species into an environment with ample food and no natural predators i d hazard a guess that the problem won t be fixed by doing the same thing again also i m no fisherman but from what i understand catching all of the fish isn t easy,2,2
334,this is a prime example of human stupidity we need a mutimillion dollar electric barrier due to fish we introduced,1,0
335,okay okay maybe i m just naive but you re spending millions of dollars to build this electrifying barrier system you re spending tons of money to power the thing why not just build some sort gate system with multiple gates is it because for some mysterious reason you have to to have the canal open i mean i guess you could have a gate system with wire mesh or holes in it enough for water movement and flow and whatnot while keeping the fish from migrating back and forth and multiple gates would negate chances of the carp from getting past into the lake or alongside a barge,3,2
336,guys i got this let me snipe the carp as they jump out of the water,5,2
337,what makes anyone think that terrorists domestic or otherwise haven t already caught and transferred carp into the great lakes,5,1
338,why does he have a stupid net sees flying angry fish ohh,1,1
339,life finds a way be it a tyranasaurus or goldfish malcolm tought us well they are probably testing the fence for weaknesses clever,3,1
340,no natural predators hmmmm do i count,2,1
341,0 04 weeee,1,1
342,nurture uh uh finds a way,5,1
343,what happens when you start messing about with nature,5,1
344,as a resident of michigan and a lover of lake erie please close that canal,5,1
345,life uh finds a way,5,1
346,imagine the electrical bill every day of every year of every decade,5,1
347,i see birds behind why ain t they effected,1,1
348,this will fail because humans always do thank the moron that brought those fish over just like the damn zebra muscles at least they were accidental,1,2
349,put that barge traffic on rail not trucks,1,1
350,focus on the uk love,5,1
351,what a waste of money what about the ships that takes in water into their balast tanks what if they take the water in the forbidden side and then dumbs it on the side they dont want them it common knowledge that fish and other living stuff gets sucked into the tanks and have been a thing that have put new spiecies new places,1,2
352,a little butter garlic,4,1
353,it s really to bad there so boney because they could be a good food source,2,2
354,why dont they add a lock so they can close it while no barges pass through in addition to the electric barrier,2,2
355,i think its very hard to close off a flowing river even some sort of net would be very disruptiv especially as it would have to be very fine as only the small fish present problem,3,2
356,life finds a way,5,1
357,but what s stopping a bad actor from catching a carp himself driving to the great lakes and then dropping the fish into the lakes,1,2
358,so we re told we re over fishing and here are rivers bursting with fish so much so we re electrifying them to death all this ecological stuff is just manipulation of the many by the few,1,2
359,what if someone just catches a few stores them and then drives to the great lakes and just releases them d i mean,1,2
360,carp ocalypse,4,1
361,this is soo stupid and pointless carps are actually a great source of food for humans and animals they also taste great too america is just too privileged and thinks bottom feeder fishes are nasty whereas the rest of the world carp is delicious food,1,2
362,hey america use this idea with your border fencing it s steel,5,0
363,that electric grid in the water is terrifying and i m sure effective i say terrifying because i had a friend years ago killed by being electrocuted in water faulty wiring on the boat dock he dropped something in the water went in to get it horrible way to go i wasn t there but i still get emotional thinking about that whole mess,4,2
364,i m an electrician all my bosses and most of my friends are gone i ve seen many men die this is 6 volts your buddy was killed with as low as 120 volts or 208 240 volts maybe as high as 277 480 volts all are lethal we try really hard to make sure what happened to your friend doesn t happen but it s a matter of budget and will the owners or operators don t usually understand the risks become complacent fail to test and maintain and people die or get severely burnt or disfigured 50 000 electrical fires in the us each year 135 a day not including electrocutions,1,2
365,rest in peace,5,1
366,not an electrical grid,1,1
367,sorry for your loss,1,1
368,i m sorry about your friend i hope that in time you can heal,2,1
369,feels like he just finished a 5k and is out of breath from it if you know what i mean,2,1
370,very complicated why not just put a net,2,1
371,why don t people overfish the carp,1,1
372,solving a human created ecological disaster with a human created ecological solution what could go wrong,1,1
373,what happens during a power outage,5,1
374,easy way to get dinner just take a boat out and let the fish jump onto your fish fry,5,2
375,humans are great at overfishing why not just overfish the carp into oblivion,5,1
376,great idea but whats going to stop some prick from putting them in a cooler and taking them around the said barriers i understand that has to be a self conscious and common sense decision not to do that but people are people and ill leave it at that,3,2
377,theoretically if you introduce the carp s natural predator would that not solve the problem what kind of ecological consequence would happen if you were to do that,2,2
378,this would probably do even more demage d now the predetor kills all the carps but will probably not stop there so the cycle continous and you have to introduce the predetors predetor into that system and so on while completly destroying everything d,2,2
379,do they tatse good,3,1
380,they do in europe carp is a protected species because of overfishing,3,2
381,why can t you net them like they do in the ocean once or twice a week for a couple of months sure you ll catch other species but they can be sorted if there s a will there s always a way at least try,3,2
382,since the economics of shutting down the canal seem unalterable how about a large crane boat lift on rails to lift a boat over a dam in the canal instead of this electric nightmare is there flow in the canal possibly it would be safer and use less power to pump water around a dam a pump could have screens to keep fish out and any that did get through would get chopped into sea gull food,2,2
383,yay and we get to pay for people s stupidity it even when i just buy food,1,1
384,time to bring a cooler full of carp and dump it into the great lakes thus thwarting millions of dollars of infrastructure,5,2
385,dam up everything the great lakes cannot take this,1,0
386,wow that s really fascinating thank you us army corps of engineers,5,1
387,the chicago ship canal has no natural right to exist it should be filled in,1,2
388,a very american solution to a very american problem,4,1
389,this would be a shocking discovery for the carp,3,0
390,the state of illinois has much bigger problems than this already,2,0
391,they put toxins in the water for when they were down for maintenance their willingness to do this is telling and they haven t learned a thing from all their meddling,4,2
392,i refuse to believe that one could destroy so much by throwing a couple of fish into the lake and yet not a single troll did it,1,2
393,they did there were tests done on the water and while they found no visual indications of any carp they found carp dna,3,2
394,thats why the energyprices are so god damn high,3,1
395,we need to change the way we think animal migration has been just as prevalent of earth as human migration if accidents occur and a species is established if we can use that situation to our advantage the money can be used to do conservation elsewhere those carp can now provide a steady sustainable resource the profits of which can be used to fix other issues safeguard similar issues occurring again and protect other areas species and habitats elsewhere that might be at risk or under threat,4,2
396,0 03 fish go burr,1,1
397,imagine a power outage and the fish getting through,5,2
398,excellent for cat food why not catch them,5,1
399,why not harvest this carp school of fish and export them to china,1,2
400,great video but it get me thinking if only certain transportation can pass i think there could be other less dangerous and expensive ways to do this like a layer of water jets pushing to one direction gates like panama canal huge fish nets paddle thingies pushing water homeless people slapping back the carps etc,4,2
401,i d gladly vote for a levy to employ homeless people slapping back the carps,1,1
402,lmaoooooo homeless people slapping back the carp,1,1
403,now that we know some idiot will release carp into great lakes for fun,5,2
404,no one notice the bird going in and out of the water as it was being shocked,1,2
405,that looks like an awful lot of ancillary substation equipment for a lousy 6 volts per inch of material,1,1
406,this is what we need to do to the rio grande,5,0
407,i hope no fish adapt and become immune to this device,5,0
408,is this not part of the great loop boating path are there not pleasure boats needing to use that canal or do they have another path,2,2
409,all because of a fish,1,2
410,i kinda wish it killed the fish,3,1
411,just have a huge cookout on the shores mmm,3,1
412,why not just reintroduce the carps natural enemy over here,1,1
413,i couldve saved the army millions of dollars by throwing a few m80 s in the lake,1,2
414,remember disney s an american tail about russian mice moving to ny city and overcoming all the adversaries to make a fresh start in the new world they could do a fish story about european carp making it through this barrier and beating the bigoted system that kept them out of the promised lakes,4,2
415,we need this at the border,5,0
416,so for how long have they been doing this and what about before they started doing this,3,0
417,karma at its best especially considering the stuff that is coming your way next the worst is yet to come schopenhauer,5,1
418,i m so sick of metric crap just say it in imperial system your in usa,1,1
419,some poor diver in the navy dive team got zapped for science,2,1
420,so you are telling i can end this guys whole careers by capturing some fish in a lake driving 100 km and releasing it in the other,5,2
421,carp problems years ago i watched two guys with a flat bottom john boat they built an air thruster fan which used a 4hp horizontal petrol engine tiller steering they had crossbows with spools of heavy test braided line they were arrow fishing for carp in two feet of water the air thruster was wakeless no startled carp in coves they shut the engine off and moved by means of a pike in two hours they speared many nasty carp the lake had been a sewage impoundment no fish were suitable for consumption however white stripers were slowly becoming more prevalent summer time temps carp stay in shallows proper game fish go deep,1,2
422,employ large nets and remove them then turn them into fertilizer,5,1
423,farmers that use electric fences to kerp animals in their property will notice less ants on their lands fire ants are not a native species to the usa beneficial harvester ants are native,3,1
424,a voltage drop of 2 5 volts per inch is going to kill something the size of a human that s a couple hundred volts potential difference from head to toe or hand to hand,2,1
425,the guy explaining reminds me of kenneth from 30 rock,5,1
426,tell joe biden turns the power grid off,1,1
427,they should get in touch with the people investigating what recently happened in the river oder in poland and germany maybe they can tell them how to kill all the carps,3,2
428,hopefuly no terrorists find out to catch a few carps and release them into the great lakes would harm the us industry around the great lakes,5,2
429,human intervention causes harm not for the carps quite the opposite,2,1
430,tom scott in my backyard,5,1
431,welp time to start eating carp,3,1
432,thanks ryan great list jazz is the ultimate expression in my opinion,5,1
433,oh no theres too much food in the river,2,1
434,what they need here is some sort of hybrid lock falkirk wheel type structure like a gondola carrying the boat with holes for draining the water and a vacuum function for sucking out fish,4,2
435,dry lock is the only way power can go out or human failure,1,1
436,power outtage all for naught me thinks,3,1
437,do the fish taste good if so,3,2
438,amazing video kyle hill youve done it again wait what its even exactly same title lmao also mind explaining the compound bows behind you d,5,1
439,they re called asian carp they re from asia,1,1
440,i dont understand things like white rhinos we ll hunt to extinction when we re not supposed to then the things we re supposed to hunt no one does you already spent 100 million dollar substation that electrifies the water why not spend another 20 000 hand out fishing poles to the locals,1,2
441,i like when people say human intervention causes harm for who for human beings we re irrelevant and like to pretend we can make or break the planet with our kindness or coldness the reality is the planet was here long before us and will be here long after us even if we wiped every large animal out poisoned every river the earth will be fine life is more robust than we imagine the planet is fine the people are f cked george carlin,5,2
442,how thick are the barriers because couldn t a carp jump them,2,2
443,wonder how much electricity it takes to electrify an entire body of water,3,1
444,smart so electrify an underwater fence to prevent famous jumping fish from getting to the other side,5,2
445,this has been a problem in many areas around the world they need to go to root cause and take care of it at the root and stop spending money on bandages fix the problem do not just keep treating symptoms to a problem use this method to get to a means to an end,1,2
446,the fish were stunned,1,2
447,something about tom scott is so annoying,2,1
448,i ve always wondered about this excellent video,5,0
449,soon there ll be electric carp jumping out the water shooting electricity like palpatine,2,1
450,army carp corp,4,1
451,border control for fish are they mexican carp barge smugglers,3,1
452,i worked at the company in massachusetts that design and built the system,5,2
453,no gonna work birds spread fish aswell either eggs on feet or small smolt,1,1
454,i hope the carp don t figure out how to dig a tunnel past this,3,0
455,a large solar flare event would disable this system,2,0
456,wow very interesting i have never even heard of this enjoyed it,5,0
457,electrify river in texas,5,1
458,i wonder what damage this is doing that we ll find out about in 50 years,3,0
459,get a load of eggs and drone them in the lakes that would mess things up ha ha,4,2
460,let s be honest this is only at best delaying the carp invasion into the great lakes,3,0
461,not as close as last time but tom scott is in my area and i don t get a chance to meet him,3,1
462,what about the pranksters who will now go out and catch a couple of buckets of carp and release them on the other side of the barrier,1,2
463,so if someone were to slip and fall in they might die asking for a friend,3,1
464,there are tons of carp in the chicago canals i don t think it s working,2,2
465,they ve been found in lake calumet which is attached to lake michigan just south of chicago so they ve made it past this and any other barriers and likely swimming around lake michigan waters,4,2
466,i remember in anchorage fish and wildlife had to poison cheney lake because some idiot introduced aggressive northern pike into it,3,1
467,alien invasive species are no joke i work in the sector in spain i ve seen the spanish military been deployed to tackle the spread of the jacinto de agua to stop it from moving to portugal,1,2
468,that s my hometown and as a heads up don t use 2 stroke engines those dam fish hate it and jump more,1,2
469,why not ship the live carps to china as part of export trade the asian community eastern europe love the carps especially fresh ones then once overfished the situation should go back to normal,1,2
470,good luck with that,4,1
471,fish have already been found above the barriers this is a huge waste of money,1,0
472,do this at the rio grande,5,0
473,prank youtubers be like i took 26 carp and put them in the great lakes opps,1,2
474,could just design a system with a small contained section that can fit the boats like a lock and the ability to pump all of the water and fish out to the carp side feels like pumping a bit of water out when a boat comes through might be cheaper than electrifying the water the whole time,3,2
475,not when you consider how much that would slow the barges,2,2
476,even fish needs a passport visa,1,1
477,they should ve just put up a sign that says no carp,1,1
478,tell me humans are disgusting and dumb without saying it,1,1
479,why not just fish them and actually take advantage now that they are overpopulated,2,2
480,that s why bow fishing is popular in illinois and state fishing regulations say once caught any and all carp can not be returned to the water dead or alive nor are any part of the fish to be dumped into the water there is no catch limit any means necessary excluding explosives electricity poison,1,2
481,oh i m sure the government won t use this too make sure folks can not fish for themselves and be self sufficient,1,0
482,what about a lock system right at the end where boats would go up an elevator so to speak right at the connection point the water in the locks could be more highly electrified as they would require less electricity than an entire open canal oh wait we don t infrastricture anymore in the us,3,2
483,right but they could jump so i would imagine they ll jump over the electrified fence,3,2
484,i would love to bring a net to pickup some stunned fish,4,1
485,it s how they make sparkling water,5,2
486,i learned something new today,5,1
487,we used this at a water supply reservoir the joke was turn up voltage amps and left fishermen in they catch the fish then reel them in over the power barrier hook em and cook em,1,2
488,so what if someone just catches some carp and dumps them past the barrier,3,2
489,anyone up for a swim,5,1
490,if worst comes to the worst those carp are going to be a good food source,1,1
491,if you wanna be successful you most take take responsibility for your emotions not place the blame on others in addition to make you feel more guilty about your faults pointing the finger at others will only serve to increase your sense of personal accountability there s always a risk in every investment yet people still invest and succeed you must look outward if you wanna be successful in life,2,2

511,summary us military pays us firms profit us citizen look dumb at the electrical bill of the us military,1,1
512,can anyone explain why it was the us army doing this rather than a civilian entity,1,0
513,ok cool but what if i just introduce the carps into the lake myself,3,2
514,congratulations on going viral for talking in front some water,1,1
515,in south africa they ll steal the electricity,1,1
516,what a great way to waste money don t you even remember what darwin said,1,1
517,in deutschland nennen wir dieses wasser sprudel,1,1
518,tom scott in chicago i was born there i recommend checking out their museum of science and industry they have an awesome foucault pendulum any many other cool exhibits,5,1
519,carp is delicious and healthy,5,1
520,carp have already been in the great lakes for at least a generation at least in lake erie even as a kid my friends and i would fish for carp in rocky river and that location was only about six miles away from the outlet of the river into lake erie i can t speak to the rest of the great lakes and i haven t lived in that area in 25 years now but there were definitely carp with unrestricted access to the great lakes a couple decades ago,4,2
521,there are different types of carp,3,1
522,so what if a bird catches a fish and drops it in the non electrified portion,2,2
523,introduce fresh water sharks next,5,1
524,they should implement a reward system for catching and disposing of the carp,4,2
525,wait wait don t say another word i got this it makes sparkly water i don t need to brag you know what i m all about dangerous stuff right here baby,5,0
526,speak the human language aka american english,5,1
527,so if you do survive the 50 mortality rate and make it beyond the shore would medical personnel come to help you,3,2
528,why would you make this video now i have to go to this il river catch some carp and release them into those lakes you are making me do this,1,0
529,i can t believe he went to peoria lmao and showed lacon on the map,1,1
530,thank you for taking the ti to do tnice tutorials i know i m gonna enjoy figuring it out,4,1
531,it s so sad the damage that invasive species can cause because they were introduced as a quick fix to a problem i m sure that most aussies know about cane toads but they were introduced to deal with cane beetles unfortunately their toxins kill a lot of native animals and they now can be found all over eastern australia humans can make such a huge impact with small decisions,2,2
532,invasive human species are the most dangerous animal,1,1
533,the uk s red squirrel population was nearly wiped out because of the introduction of the grey squirrel luckily they re making a bit of a come back,3,2
534,let s electrocute a river might also be a small decision fraught with problems later on i can t imagine this working some idiot just needs to drop a family of the carp in the great lakes and it s all for nothing,2,2
535,invasive species humans,5,1
536,socialism democratic way see the public debts of nations no more words,1,1
537,there s one more invasive species we forgot to mention humans,2,1
538,toads carp rabbits deer pigs camels millipedes ants yep we aussies have many introduced pests,1,1
539,the same as aussies,5,1
540,the australians have experience also with rabbits,4,1
541,just another example of a long list of government failures,1,1
542,i remember the simpsons episode but never looked into what it was really about,3,1
543,not water though assassins from abroad are there don t know their targets,1,1
544,just build a fence under water wtf,1,1
545,they can t get 1000 fishing boats with gill nets and pay them to clean this mess up we can supposedly over fish everything but asian carp,1,2
546,im really sad all my great lakes are in danger from one thing or another,1,1
547,or send the sea lions that over run portland oregon to that place,1,2
548,introduce seals to see if they will hunt the carp and play killer whale recordings to keep the seals from straying g into the electric zone,4,2
549,100 lies,1,1
550,close the canal ya greedy goofs,1,1
551,i guess controlling the spread of invasive fish species can be a bit of a carp shoot,3,2
552,what if a bird picks one up then drop it on the other side of the barrier there s eagles everywhere in il idk if they d go for carp though,2,2
553,my neck of the woods i live about 15 miles north of peoria the carp are a definite problem,2,1
554,tom scott having paid a visit to romeoville is the funniest thing to me,5,1
555,one lethal mistake after another our federal wildlife agencies only design management methods using killing not able to come up with non lethal methods it s so barbaric,1,1
556,if you catch an asian carp you are to kill it and report it inthe lakes you are never to return a live carp to the lakes,1,2
557,2 24 i never thought i would ever hear in my life us army and fish barrier together in my life xd us army electric fish barrier,5,1
558,a bird carrying a carp is gonna be your worst enemy,1,1
559,so it s all about money what would be the big deal these fish can be eaten just like the game fish they could feed the homeless with them but no rich pricks gotta be able to ride their boats without worrying about getting smacked in the head by a fish,3,2
560,so what you re saying is it s no more effective than a net that needs to be lowered for barges i don t get it,2,2
561,all that sweet gear yet no bow fishing footage,5,1
562,is there nothing we can do about invasive carp bounties for fisherman per pound,1,0
563,why does this seem so unlikely to work,1,0
564,if they shift everything to electric and solar or wind they won t be able to use this method to stop those fish from reaching the great lakes this whole green thing will end up in an ecological nightmare,1,2
565,and why,5,1
566,because military wants to kill of 97 of us,1,1
567,but are they tasty,3,1
568,why not just have a dam and then open it on and turn on the current then seems like that would save a lot of power,2,2
569,can they be consumed i mean the fish,3,2
570,this will fail in time,1,0
571,ahhh another american ahhh nvm i ve ran out of ideas and putting toxins in water rufff i m canadian and i m worried i ve been worried since i was born since i knew about the us,1,1
572,ah yes,5,1
573,just a matter of time,1,1
574,notice how they can t even call them asian carp anymore,1,1
575,the us govt should just open up the carp infested waters to fishing humanity manages to accidentally wipe out whole species over fishing the carp menace into extinction shouldn t be a problem,1,2
576,we already fish carp infested waters constantly there is still too many to deal with they breed stupidly fast,1,1
577,i didn t know about this thank you for sharing this i love learning new things about this crazy state i live in less smog and pollution is a good thing sorry i hope it never gets shut down,5,0
578,you were 5 miles from my house,5,1
579,i saw a program about scottish fisherman using lasers to kill bugs on farmed salmon the makers of this program should communicate with the americans to see how they do it,4,2
580,carps are a natural species in china however in most waterbodies they are not very easy to find they have an ultimate predator fishermen in fact overfishing has been a problem in fresh water in china and sometimes i sit there for a day and cannot get a single bite probably promoting fishing could reduce the amount of carps in the us carps are delicious but i guess americans would hate eating them for having so many bones,3,2
581,it s us why not use gun,1,1
582,wouldn t it be easier to introduce predators to keep the carb in check,3,2
583,introducing another invasive species to deal with a different invasive species is a really bad idea people have tried it in the past and it has always ended in ecological disaster australia is a prime example,2,2
584,couldn t they just make a wall from one side to the other,1,2
585,for some reason they didn t use machine guns or explosives that s weird innit,3,1
586,so we are good at overfishing entire oceans but we can t overfish a river the nets could be smaller and apparently the fish is a plenty carp is edible right it s delicious why not do what we do best and overfish the hell out of that species,3,2
587,the demand for carp isn t that high in the us and they still breed in insane numbers dragging colossal multi kilometer nets across the ocean floor is a lot easier than fishing carp out of a river or dragging them up with tiny nets,3,2
588,carp this fish is one of the tastiest it does not taste dry in many european countrys it is served on new year s eve and very expensive too its not a invasive problem you have no one who wants to fish plus you don t know about the sumptuous taste quality money floats in the river thx for the vid,5,2
589,fascinating stuff i didn t even know i didn t know about,5,1
590,what if the fish just got on the train bypass the whole thing wouldn t they,1,2
591,my thoughts exactly,5,1
592,11 million views jfc,5,1
593,okay but what would happen if someone say just caught a bunch of carp and released them in the great lakes,3,2
594,couldn t a citizen just transplant the carp themselves,1,1
595,if it has no natural predator we ll become its predator,3,1
596,can you imagine billions of dollars being laundered with this project rather then just allow citizens to fish the carp out dry for free,1,2
597,except they already are fishing the carp out but there is still too many carp you cannot outfish a carp with the current population of us fishermen you d need millions of fishermen constantly fishing the rivers very hard labour compared to doing it at sea so unless the us stops the rest of the fishing to deal with carp or gets a lot more fishermen it ll remain a problem,2,2
598,so carp are like the humans of the sea,3,2
599,you know those anti mine ropes that get shot out at great distances to clear mines for tanks couldn t the government use something like that or similar in the heavily populated areas of carp explosions under water cause immediate harm to biological creatures i can see this as a way to quickly lower the carp population if it s really that bad out of control,4,2
600,that also hurts the normal fish though which they really do not want to harm even more than they already are getting harmed it s also expensive to get all the requirements to fish with explosives,2,2
601,i highly recommend everybody that s interested in this look at the youtube video done by kyle hill in relation to the rules that the coast guard has to follow in regard to this area,5,0
602,tonight at 9 electric fish shocking fishermen in the great lakes region and why the us army recommends fishing poles with no metal parts,5,2
603,damn this video blew up i guess it was really electrifying,1,0
604,they must do the same thing to my drinks at the bar sometimes i wake up and have no idea what happened,5,2
605,gotta say 24 7 sessions of non stop fish tassing is a great way to spend electricity,5,1
606,i have those same rockford boat speakers they are wicked,5,1
607,a question what is the purpose of what appears to be several compound bows that are behind you in the opening seconds of the video,3,2
608,why not kill the fish you say at 95 of the eco stop stunning them,5,2
609,your problem isn t the river it s the great blue heron god designed them to pick up unmatched eggs by their feet feathers each time they step they have a good chance of eggs gathering under the feathers so when they fly to the next location like a great lake they ll deposit those eggs and your river system meant nothing,5,2
610,we should do that with the rio grande,3,0
611,to charge the eels,4,1
612,what s wrong with fish being in the lake,1,2
613,not an expert on fishing but can carp be eaten or commercially fished for fish oil or something like that could help with bringing numbers down just a thought,3,2
614,0 o all it takes is a salty fisherman to transport 1 fish over,1,1
615,you need police fish that catch trespassing carp and harass them until they go back to where they came,4,2
616,as an american and a fan of electric barriers i can safely say,5,1
617,wow so many jumping fish,5,1
618,if your filming a video in america then use our metic system,5,1
619,your literally on an american website son,1,1
620,why does it matter,1,1
621,acting as if trucks are the only alternative to barges as a train is running by this waterway could be replaced by rail as far as i know carp don t hitch a ride on trains is it really that simple probably not the obvious ideas to a non expert me aren t always a good way to solve the problem and sometimes just plain wrong headed nevertheless why not use trains instead,2,2
622,uh and how much does this amazingly expensive activity cost the taxpayers every year and up front to build it,1,0
623,i m a bavarian recreational fisherman and carp is an expensive delicacy in germany this looks like carp paradise to me,5,0
624,they re asian carp the flesh itself is ok i hear but there are lots of bones in the muscle tissue so they aren t very desireable for human consumption the whole affair of their introduction to north america and release into the wild is another reminder that judeo european colonization and imperialism has been a calamity for the people and land of america in the sense of the whole landmass from arctic to antarctic,3,2
625,how about trawling the rivers constantly and use the caught carp for cat food and some type of feed,4,2
626,this will not work it will only delay the carp only solution is to fill in part of the canal the barges can unload and reload it would be a pain in the ass but easier than getting rid of the carp once they get through they could pump the sewage through pipes,1,2
627,so smooth everytnice tutorialng he says goes into my brain and sticks in,5,1
628,what are our options for trapping and killing the carp,5,1
629,because as citizens were just the governments guinea pigs,1,1
630,just wait until i tell my fish friends about the weak spot in the barrier,3,1
631,i don t understand his bird logic,2,1
632,return to combat area,1,1
633,what a load of carp,5,1
634,this is awesome,5,0
635,if these carps are in the philippines this problem will be over in less than a week,1,0
636,ok maybe that was a slight exaggeration but it would still,3,1
637,very interesting,5,1
638,even with the minor uncertainties and inconveniences around this it s still a good thing there s actual smort people working on the problem my solution would ve involved a lot more dynamite,4,2
639,what happens if there s a blackout,1,1
640,another video about my hometown,5,1
641,they the fish will eventually get through the answer is genetics,3,2
642,human intervention causes harm ahhh how i wish corona was actually 100 lethal,1,1
643,go to lake crescent and sorell in tasmania australia i think they re the only lakes in the world to successfully eradicate carp it took 20 years,5,2
644,wait so the thing is super deadly to humans but a mere inconvenience or temporary knock out for the fish i don t understand my uneducated simple mind proposes a different plan interrupt the canal by closing a section and filling it with concrete have two canal wide boat ramps on either side and install a type of conveyer belt caterpillar tracks kind of like on army tanks get the whole thing working on solar or wind power and make it super resilient the army people are good at that then you can have barges being pulled out of the water and back in on the other side while the fish can t this could work on anything with a somewhat flat bottom or a fin that is removable sailboats kayaks and canoes would not be able to cross it but they can cross it by taking their vessel out of the water like they always do and they re not cargo carriers anyways engineer people tell me kindly why this would be an unattainable idea please,2,2
645,the rapidly pulsing electricity in the canal tends to cause problems for human hearts which are also incidentally pulsing and are of course much bigger than that of a fish s in comparative size,2,2
646,cut off a humans head they will die cut off a chickens head they will walk around for a couple of minutes cut a worm in half and there is a fair chance one half will live bacteria well they can live in just about any environment magic,1,1
647,unless someone delivers them there,1,1
648,i always turn your videos down to 0 75 speed it keeps my heart rate down,5,1
649,it s only a matter of time before it fails to stop a carp or two,2,1
650,perhaps this is unrealistic but isnt there a something they can so about the craps like mass fishing nets or draining certain areas and gathering them idk,3,2
651,and then some people gets really angry at me when i call humans are cancer go figure,2,1
652,and yet we keep messing about with nature thinking we know what we are doing and can control it transplanting animals as an easy way to mitigate a problem like in this case and what happened in australia messing with the weather making it rain on command and so many more things people are a virus,5,2
653,why not just capture it and make delicious dish,3,1
654,european carp entered australia s outback waterways in the 1970s and devastated the native biota fish crayfish and most of the river vegetative species it took nearly fifty years for any sort of correction to take place leaving the whole system today completely corrupted,1,2
655,european common carp didn t enter australia people took them there same as they did in the usa as far back as the 1800s carp have been reared as food in europe for centuries and misguided businessmen thought breeding and selling them was an easy way to make money what they didn t take into account was that in warmer waters they spread like wildfire,1,2
656,inaction of aus government they just don t give a 2 clocks about environment,1,1
657,tldr dangerous fish get tazed,1,1
658,if you said guess why you can t kayak from the gulf of mexico to the great lakes none of my guesses would be because of a deadly electric fish barrier,1,2
659,plenty of birds in the background all the time trying to get the floating fish brutal,3,2
660,100 murica xd,5,1
661,hey trump supporters this is where all your lost votes are go for a quick dive to find them,5,0
662,wow that push boat is the epitome of world class naval architecture you can tell how much effort and passion went into her timeless refined design truly breathtaking and i consider myself blessed to have even just briefly witnessed such a poignant example of fine shipbuilding,5,1
663,ecosystem at all,5,1
664,electric water yo lemme just throw my phone in there let it charge rq,1,1
665,americans and their complicated solutions why not just put nets,2,1
666,flying carp fly barges do not any net high enough to prevent fish would surely be high enough to impede ships,3,1
667,because murica,2,1
668,ok ok yt recommended i relent i ll watch jees,3,1
669,the thing i find funniest about the situation is that they are nearly extinct in their natural habitat westerners find them disgusting but like everything else they re considered a delicacy in china so they have been overfished they are now buying them from the us,3,2
670,a lot of coulds in this and a lot of money going into stopping carp migration when all it takes is one guy that hates everything going on to box them up and just move them over,1,2
671,i live off lake heron and can say the great lakes defiantly have carp,5,2
672,i wasn t watching with my eyes but i was expecting the guy explaining the system to be in ocp s,3,2
673,if 95 of the biomass in that water why not just electrocute the fish,2,2
674,why don t they add lock gates also it would make the ships go slower they can run higher voltages and when the fish and stunned they take the carp out and supply the restaurants,2,2
675,they don t add lock gates because there are lock gates in all the places were one might want to put lock gates,2,1
676,he reminds me of connor o malley,4,1
677,great work bro you explain the whole things very clearly thanks for sharing with us,5,1
678,anyone wanna go for a swim,1,1
679,why is no one else talking about how wrong he said algae it s al gee,1,1
680,he is british so he uses the british pronunciation,3,1
681,how did you the ad the well i guess thats a tom scott video for ya,3,1
682,great plot for a horror movie,5,1
683,and they say they are saving ecosystem,5,2
684,shut it down southern illinois dont care about chicago,1,1
685,closet full of red shirts ok mark zuckerburg,4,1
686,uhhhhh i live in kenosha wi fish michigan often there are definitely carp in there i catch too many,2,1
687,there s native carp but the invasive carp is different,3,2
688,i sometimes wondered how bull sharks who have swam up as far as alton il in the mississippi river didn t continue into the illinois river and make it to the great lakes now i know one reason,2,2
689,i am a bull shark and i disagree i currently live in lake ontario i would tell you my story of how i got here but it is hard to type with fins,3,2
690,from that time jesus began to preach and to say repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand matthew 4 17 ye have heard that it hath been said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth but i say unto you that ye resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek turn to him the other also matthew 5 38 39,5,2
691,amazing work love the words from the engineer,5,1
692,what about a net,5,1
693,sheldon reservoirin texas had a carp problem a bounty was offered by the pound,1,1
694,wonder if they will adapt to the electricity there are electric eels,3,2
695,i just don t understand why in china it cost very expensive but here they don t want it,2,1
696,why don t we invite the chinese fish companies to net these carbs out make them no tax and free tariff,1,1
697,isn t dc voltage that pulses just ac voltage at a lower hz,2,1
698,just tell everyone that carp are edible and good for cat food and the carp would be cleaned out in a jiffy from over fishing,4,2
699,so to solve world hunger we need a carp recipe,3,1
700,a california lake had a problem with the northern pike being an invasive species fish and game poisoned the entire lake imagine the smell of every fish in the lake coming to the surface dead but most of them were pikes,1,2
701,how 2 3v can be dangerous to a person i mean a car has 12v and unless you put two wires to your mouth it will not harm you,1,1
702,this was fascinating o,5,0
703,so this human interaction we ll see the damage from in 20 50 years i assume,5,0
704,these fish will soon find away to breach this check point,1,0
705,i don t see they can t build another electric fence 5 miles up river kill off everything in that 5 mile stretch restock it with native fish and then do the next 5 mile stretch,1,2
706,0 02 fishy jumping for freedom,1,1
707,like some type of fresh water sea bass just be happy they didn t release easter eggs into the water,4,2
708,all good until the looming power cuts hit,2,1
709,i m wondering wouldn t it be much cheaper for them to make layers on layers of huge mesh fences both above and below water in the canal so the carp can t come through edit i guess they need to be able to move barges through,3,2
710,i hope aliens don t watch this and see how stupid we are,1,0
711,blasted watching this,1,0
712,petroleum from your boat and your lipstick ruin nature,1,1
713,this is just balloon tower defence irl,5,0
714,bro in twenty years there s just gonna be electromagnetically desensitized fish all up in the lake,1,2
715,why weren t nets used as a barrier to prevent the fish,1,1
716,nets prevent barges,3,1
717,how about a bubble net maybe a bubble net would work,3,1
718,i love how he points out the city s only care about money and not there own environment money made them care that s it,5,1
719,let few chinese fishing here for a year you will be surprised at the extinction of this fish,1,0
720,what happens if a flood,1,1
721,hehe at 3 32 there is a duck on the left d,1,1
722,carp are edible i m surprised some company hasn t moved in to process them into food sure beats bug protein,3,1
723,but what if i catch a bunch of them and take them up stream a couple miles and release them,2,2
724,i still remember when obama didn t do anything about these carp when brought upon attention,5,1
725,30 kilos where you from,1,1
726,need to do the same to rio grande,3,0
727,it seems like catching these fish would be an easier solution if 95 of the fish are carp and if releasing poison is already a frequent occurrence surely the land of a thousand nukes could come up with a solution,3,2
728,birds can carry the fish over,4,2
729,damn you were in my areea and i didn t even know i d have loved to stop and say hi,1,1
730,so in essence it s an open air aqua battery i m surprised that grass grows near it would be an excellent place for those that tend to absorb electrical currents to avoid at all costs,3,2
731,no this will not have any effect because voltage current resistance therefore 3 i 1000 naturally human body resistance is around few thousand ohms current i 0 003 amp conclusively this level of current wont effect on our body,1,0
732,otherwwise great video you re audio is a little loud,5,1
733,0 42 what the f is a kilometer,1,1
734,i live in lacon we have a population of like 2000 people no way he came here,1,1
735,i live in lacon no where he came here the most random place this guy could go,1,0
736,you are guarantee the powers that be will get them in there bet me,4,2
737,so i could single handedly ruin americas economy by putting a tank of karp on the other side if it,2,2
738,this is one of those things that would be particulary difficult to explain to aliens,3,0
739,bro you were a couple minutes from my house damn,1,1
740,speak slowly dude,5,1
741,why don t we just fish all those carp into near extinction we ve done it with other fish species usually ones we don t want that to happen to,1,2
742,10 million views on a tom scott video,5,1
743,actually closing canal would give more jobs to truckers government are idiots believe me i m a military veteran and our country is going down toilet fast love of money root of all evil god,1,1
744,while this video is great it doesn t mention a huge issue which is mis identifying common carp naturalized in the us and buffalo similar to a carp native to the us and extremely similar to carp as the serious invasive species of silver carp or bighead carp this has caused a witchhunt for these mostly harmless species simply because they are carp as well so many people will just kill any carp they come across because they think any carp is invasive and its terrible when this occurs in that sense while the video is great for calling out this issue of asian carp in these waters i think you should ve said something specifying that there is this other issue as well as i can guarantee that people will see this video and further be influenced to believe all carp are the issue and catch and kill them which is just not correct so please on the chance that you catch a carp please know that if its not an asian or bighead carp there is absolutely 0 reason to kill it in fact its best to release them as they are incredibly fun to catch and don t hurt the ecosystem at all,2,2
745,so fish now need to carry i d to swim in any water fish can now be pulled over just for looing like an asian carp fish profiling wow,1,2
746,here s your tax money,5,1
747,drinkinggamesuggestion take a shot every time someone says barrier,1,1
748,you d think they would drain the canals,3,2
749,and put legs on the barges,5,2
750,someone could just take a few carp and release them into the great lakes too,2,2
751,should use the same technique in the rio grande to combat illegals from crossing,4,0
752,nah rather shouldn t,3,1
753,we just don t learn about not taking species out of their natural environment and putting them where they don t belong do we,1,2
754,holy mackerel i sure didn t expect to see him in my city this video i guess important people just roll on through without much of a fuss anymore,5,0
755,are they tasty,3,1
756,giant tesla coil attached to a speedboat ultracap bank,5,1
757,would this work in the rio grande river we have an invasive species coming across that river as well,3,0
758,dredge the whole river and export the carp meat to china they are having food shortages,1,2
759,ah yes but their suffering makes the us look stronger,3,1
760,this is really cool thanks tom,5,0
761,i m curious how electricity doesn t just go to ground impure water is a good conductor and any electric currents have a huge ground available at low resistance i find this explanation rather hard to believe,3,0
762,life uh finds a way,5,1
763,i grew up in a part of new jersey that usually only had carp and catfish in the sixties the carp didn t drive out the native species pollution did the carp merely managed to survive more pollution than did bass when the eco revolution came and waters were improved the other fish returned it s easy to blame the carp that doesn t make it correct,2,2
764,another thing to consider those carp are not the same as in this video there has yet to be any asian carp in nj to my knowledge the ones in your state are naturalized common carp and are no immediate threat but they do survive well in pollution so you are totally correct,3,2
765,they couldn t just put up a fence under the water they had to invest in electrocution efforts to be put in place instead seems drastic also how is poisoning the water ok how do they not see that this seeps into other waterways,2,2
766,the ships would destroy the fence poisoning the water isn t ok of course,3,2
767,invasive asian carp are a serious problem and i sure hope we can keep them out of the great lakes i m not feeling hopeful though,3,2
768,in order to cross this body of water you need a freaking room on the boat to not get hit in the head,4,0
769,thats really just kinda evil leave nature alone,2,1
770,close it down its not worth it,1,1
771,so if the power goes out,3,1
772,it s all fun and games until the government shows up at your house,4,1
773,get a fishing strategy in place to catch some carp they would easily feed a poor family,4,2
774,gotta do what the austrillians did with the emus just put a bounty on carps and jimbob and his buddy dan will solve all your issues albeit a bit of dynamite might be involved,4,2
775,why don t they come up with a permanent solution like sterilizing the water ways repopulating with native species,1,2
