9,most women do not want to deal with male pain if it interferes with the satisfaction of female desire yeah everyone who supports the red pill agrees with you there s a reason women have such distain for these men because it s not attractive why emotional men are reckless women perceive them as dangerous and not in a bad boy kind of good way as in he can t control his emotions he might hurt me kind of way men who allow their emotions to dictate their actions are a complete disaster an unreactive man is a good man why do certain men abuse their women or kids because they are unable to control their emotions why do certain men rape because they are unable to control their desires why do certain men feel the need to kick the shit out of each other because they are unable to control their anger telling men to express their emotions is a very bad message a good man is a stoic man he does not allow how he feels to dictate his actions he is in control of his mind is mind is not in control of him you shouldn t talk about your emotions with a women if you want her to stick around women are simply not attracted to weak men who are not in control of their own life because weak men who aren t in control are dangerous,1,1

12,it soo funny to see everyone glance over the actual positions and merits of the rp philosophy and completely disregard the reason people are drawn to it in the first place in this community what is idealized is the nuclear family and a marriage with a young woman who is able to create a large family while that marriage lasts a lifetime if one is going to happen at all these men idealize and want to become the gentil patriarch or heroic artisan are also probably religious conservatives and capitalist s if you want to make a video about dissecting rp or manosphere go over the people like rollo tammassi patrice o neil alexander grace tom leykis some simple truths dating for most men is trash especially in the modern age i e demanding traditional male role while not fufilling the traditionally female role social media expands dating pools exponentially in the past everyone would be out and about not glued to their phone giving more opportunities to the average man men s sexual thirst for women on the net is mostly at fault here why date one average guy when you could have 1000 s of simps paying 5 a month to see ur puss puss average man by modern standards cant support a family let alone a woman s ever growing expectations 5 7 5 8 42k yr 39 waist one of the most common statements is that women prefer men who make 1 5x what they do minimum disregarding the ones who say 100k only or 250k or other dumb shit housing prices are also so high that in most cities 50k a year wont qualify you to purchase a house something essential for building wealth and establishing a family they say women want it all but most men would be satisfied being happy divorce is initiated by women 70 80 of the time and even more if college educated women wait to meet winners at the finish line ever since school age the men who where most desired had things wealth or looks while the rest got as close to 0 attention as humanly possible once we achieve and grow we eventually become a preferred choice after being disrespected for decades then you expect us to accept children out of wedlock and want guys to pay for all your kids macdonald s the system is designed to be played by a 2 person team and there are hardly any teammates available if 2 people made 80 100k and were willing to move to a less desirable place a family unit could easily be established theres still 50 100k houses for sale in america women don t do their part in reducing costs of building a family and instead want to compete for the breadwinner position and in doing so only increase the expenses a family must put out to cover a 2 working person house hold the whole point of a breadwinner horseperson is to make the breadwinner able to work more because one simply cannot work 60 80hrs and do home stuff and home stuff like cooking diy improvements childcare management housework are all significant causes for expense that can be mitigated through one person dedicating themselves to reducing those costs ex i could go to a restaurant and spend 50 on one meal but that same 50 in the grocery store could feed a family of four for 1 2 meals same with child care its likely going to cost 60 80 of a persons wage to cover child care without government funding most household tasks can be done simultaneously giving more personal time than would be possible in the jobs most breadwinners would take one of the most common complaints on this subject is that homemaking doesn t pay yes and no yes because it doesn t pay you with a check every 2 week but if you took his last name 50 of the equity is yours no matter what while childrearing also provides you with a guaranteed income post marriage if you decide to leave for any reason valid or not competition for the breadwinner position also increases the workforce which in turn stagnates and reduces wages due to supply and demand women s financial support has a time limit while men are expected to finically support their partner and family for the rest of their life weather they divorce or not alimony child support which is almost always awarded to women through the unjust family courts everyone says till death do you part but wont follow through with the decision and contract they brought into existence of their own free will were all adults here nobody was tricked or forced even in arranged marriages the women and their families have the power to decide weather to follow through or not 1 5 men men who have paternity tested children find out they are taking care of kids who their wife made them believe was their biological child and is not women do not usually face charges for this type of fraud family courts favor women tremendously men in need are under supported and left to rot hardly any men s shelters or safe spaces for men women regularly have random sexual escapades with many guys in their young years demand almost nothing of them then wait till the eggs are almost dried up to find the supportive family building type of guy then have a long list of demands for him to meet and deal with because of the trauma she obtained in her younger years all while the supportive family type of guy was toiling away working and learning how to make a larger than average amount of income probably at the detriment of his sex life,2,1

31,matthew hussey is so far from being a red pill or even of these toxic people you have on here his main focus is on taking back power i don t think you ve researched enough about him to put him on here he s a dating coach and most of what he says has merit i haven t seen anything from him be toxic so gtfo with your portly researched analysis,1,2

49,i agree that a lot of men are toxic and the mano sphere is a problem that being said if this many men are agreeing with sentiments like women don t care about your problems or you will be emotionally punished by women for being vulnerable maybe that s something we should actually address it just seems strange how hesitant we are to entertain the idea that misandry by women in certain areas maybe are also part of patriarchy,2,1
50,noah also gets wrong about the second clip because its not about not expressing you feelings as a man you can but not in ways where the woman would percieve you as a red flag theres a limit one should try to make a first date as fun and positive as possible,2,2

57,okay i hate it when people act like women don t have it easier when it comes to sex or getting into a relationship i mean i hate alpha males they re dumb but women always have it easier when it comes to getting into relationships and having sex who basically who they want to if a woman sees someone they find attractive at a bar she is more then likely going to be able to go home with them rather then a man finding someone attractive and going home with her i don t care if a woman wants to be with 1000 men in one night but she more then a man will be able to do that,3,1
58,some of the criticism against women that red pill men talk about is valid women do cheat lie and abuse men when men come together to warn other men of these horrible women to avoid how are they now incels implying that any time a man criticizes a woman he s automatically a incel does not lead to any positive outcomes abusive women deserve to be called out for their horrible behavior and not praised for it,1,1

73,i feel so bad for these guys i ve had some low times but i m glad i didn t go there,1,0
74,i think many of the red pill content out there are poor attempts to try to create a healthy public discourse for men s issues like the fact that june is only seen as pride month but so many people forget it is also men s mental health awareness month it seems like a lot of mens concerns are just pushed to the side or ignored completely and if we truly mean progress for all or progress for none well then,2,1
75,it s so weird that we all agree that society s rules for upholding masculinity suck and cause of lot of stress and anger but the red pill solution is to fully lean into these rules uphold them by any means necessary give these rules more power by taking agency away from women and attack anybody who questions these rules,5,1
76,real hard cold fact advice that will shatter the fake reality you live in girls don t ever date a man who wears a cap on a daily basis as shown in this video clearly proves my point he is hiding a receeding hairline he has insecurities and will be jealous until he eventually cheats on you because he is convinced you did it first no seriously why is first dude wearing a swimming cap,1,2
77,it s most likely a durag,3,0
78,the idea of change happening from within the oppressive system is so important the goal of healing is not to become ok with a shit system but to work to dismantle it i find a lot of men have done a lot of work accepting a bad hand or a shit deal and because they have gotten over it they think everyone has to also just integrate with the oppressive status quo it s kind like a sunk cost in economics they ve invested so much energy over the years into being ok with emotional unavailability that they prescribe this same journey to others as the only way out of self loathing,2,1

83,ohhh the paying thing can be so awkward i like to split the bill especially on the first date but some blokes really get offended as if i had emasculated them by wanting to pay my share and keeping in mind that a lot of the power men have over women is connected to women s financial dependancy created by sociaty on men yea maybe demonstrating your financial independancy does hurt their sense of masculinitiy i guess a very clear red flag immedeately settles the question if there will be a second date or not good filter,2,1

91,you completely took that clip 22 30 out of context matthew hussey had a discussion with the women in his seminar if the man had to pay for a date and the women said yes so they do expect it he s wrong with his point here but what you suggest here is not what he said and he s not a redpiller so he shouldn t be on the thumbnail,1,1
92,i actually enjoy that youre trying to understand whats behind their reasoning and explain why it s wrong i think that s gonna help more in making people see their bullshit than when you just shout at them that theyre terrible wrong dumbies,4,1

96,counter argument for the men should pay trope women used to not be able to get a job or obtain their own capital so they weren t really able to pay for dates so obviously the men were supposed to pay cause women didn t have anything to give that being said i like the the one who takes the other on a date should pay trope,1,1

104,that clip between 23 and 24 minutes was really manipulatively edited if you watch the whhhoollleee clip the woman in the audience actually expected the man that she s dating to continuously pay for her for every date and said verbatim he should pay because he s the man the guy on stage was totally within his right to say if you don t offer to pay you weren t raised right if you don t pay that s fine but if you don t even offer to pay you clearly have full financial expectation on the other person not cool,1,2

145,i know it s one small part of the video but i want to chime in on the who pays for a date question my view is automatically split it and if not whoever does the asking pays if i ask you to dinner i m paying if you ask me to dinner i will be prepared and expect to pay for my own dinner but am anticipating that you re planning to pay for dinner not that i expect nor require you to pay i just think it s on the person who does the asking if it s not split,2,1
146,wow matthew hussey really shit the bed on this one comparing paying for dinner to having sex on demand every time also sex workers charge more than an average dinner would cost,1,0
147,the main problem with the red pill is there is no grey area with them they think purely in black and white everything is a middle ground thing,2,1
148,the thing about men not being able to express their feelings is so engrained that many people choose to believe it out of comfortability of that women as it might be easier to ignore things men because they re used to that it s like a comfort zone thing my dad is smart and my older sister too though they still snark at the idea of nature vs nurture and believe that men and women are born so different that men naturally are supposed to be strong providers and have to hide their feelings blah blah they even say that men feel less that women in general and if i say something about that they just say that it s feminist s propaganda and that it s ruining masculinity of today i just can t,2,1
149,21 10 or maybe it could be every other or just pay for what you bought if you feel weird having them pay just offer to split or cover next time it s literally that easy me and the person i ve been seeing are both nonbinary and we ve been either splitting paying the next time or if i drove for example they paid and vice versa super easy,1,1

153,she can t have male friends i suspect all males of doing what i would do hanging around non romantically interested women pretending to be their friends in the hopes that i can smash someday when she s super vulnerable who should pay for the date everybody pays for their own food therefore none of this a date is actually delayed prostitution sh t can be pulled and she s obviously a gold digger because she insisted on the fancy restaurant thing wouldn t happen,1,1

155,i saw you first on tara mooknee s channel and am now a fan and subscriber you are hilarious and very intelligent thanks for the premium content,5,2
156,i would only think the man should pay if they are the one asking the person out if you re wording it like hey i d love to take you to dinner sometime and then want to split the bill i could see how that might be taken the wrong way hey want to go out to dinner together just doesn t sound as nice to me maybe because i want to be the one who pays though as i like doing nice things for others that said i m married now and we generally still do whoever suggests it pays if i mention i want chinese food i pay she mentions she wants sushi she pays works for us we like being able to do nice things for each other there is no gender role bs behind it,3,1

167,no you should better yourself in productive ways that dont involve hating women like idk hitting the gym taking a shower starting a skin care routine getting your life put together,1,0
168,the way i always deal with the who should pay for a date is with these steps 1 only go out if i have enough money to spend 2 order food that i have enough to pay for myself 3 offer to pay for the food when we are done 4 fight with the guy about who is going to pay 5 be the fastest one to hand the money to the server,5,1
169,its really weird how these guys who always want full control over their partners are straight up openly looking for abused people to be with just so they can abuse them more because they know they ll be easy to use,2,1
170,off topic but you look like an older kit connor that has a moustache and long hair,3,2

176,i think it s not that hard to think if i ask someone on a date then it s assumed i pay or i should clarify before said date that it ll be split my partner pays some dates and i pay some other dates and sometimes we ll split also yeah using someone s body is different than two people going on a date double standard double standard would be the woman asking a guy on a date and expecting him to pay in full,3,1

179,redpill stuff is so quietly pervasive in the dating world and it s really easy as a single and dating woman to get sucked in and spiral whenever i m reminded how many men out there feel this way the bit about men will only marry who they want to and women will only marry who they can def is hitting me in the i can t find a decent guy to commit to me which means i must be unlovable and will never be worth committing to core belief it takes effort to return to a baseline of remembering that there are guys out there who aren t shitbags it s just that this sort of stuff gets platformed by young and clueless men who honestly aren t likely even being faced with the choice of having multiple women to decide on marrying anyway edit having watched on some you re right about the who does this help what purpose does it serve question i think it s the emotional version of just work hard nerd boy and one day you ll be the boss of those guys that bullied you in high school yeah she won t have sex with you now but you ll get to turn her down for marriage once she s old and dried up,5,1

193,17 40 my guy is playing a worship song behind his redpill alpha bro advice so that s something it s oceans by hillsong the megachurch i grew up in was obsessed with it,5,0
194,by these guys own logic would it not be more manly to be able to face heartbreak and other various emotions and process them rather than to hide their feelings like are these dudes really admitting to be cucked by their own emotions i dunno seems pretty weak to me,2,1
195,the tom and jerry thing is aave btw,5,0
196,i ll never stop finding it funny that incels chose the term red pill to describe their aspirations to toxic masculinity in reference to what they didn t know was a thinly veiled metaphor for estrogen pills in a story that is itself a metaphor for being trans,1,1

203,reading the comments i m really glad i m not the only one who believes that whoever pays should be whoever invited the other to go on a date,4,1
204,thinking about the gender roles of who should pay is so interesting because even when i m the one paying i hand the card or cash to my boyfriend and he does the actual transaction for me and i ve never given that a second thought i was just like yeah ur the guy so u pay the person but i ve never thought of it as it always has to be his money that s so interesting to me,5,1
205,dude the youtube algorithm s reaction to watching some of these far right con artists is frightening you are bombarded with all manner of all right grifting from politics to incels red pill to strange alternative history essays that excuse the actions of various autocrats etc alt right pipeline is real and robust in 2022,5,1

214,i feel ways about this im just gonna say thank you for existing noah thank you v many,5,2
215,this is only my second clip of noah so i might need to see more to have a better conclusion but so far i feel you have the best intentions of wanting to shed light on the problems the manosphere seems to have especially the relationship misconceptions with women i applaud you for the effort i ve watched red pill content but always with a grain of salt as i could never agree with everything they say or their approach to relationships they do however bring up some of the double standards and unfair expectations society has for men to which i can confirm from my own experience that being said looking through the comments it seems despite your best efforts to bring a healthy light on some of their problematic issues the praise of your positive intent is a bit overshadowed by the glee of bashing the subjects of your analysis not your fault at all but the comments very much resemble the comments on some of the redpill content creators i ve watched youtube is full of echo chambers so this isn t surprising but folks that watch seem to have their hate of the content creators validated and then basically high five each other and go yeah they suck collectively its all just the same stuff a group state their beliefs and ridicules those that don t share their beliefs then another groups responds and ridicules them back and vice versa i still will watch more of your content cause you re funny and have good critique just don t know if your audience will lean more pro positivity or more collective bashing not that yt has any shortage,4,1

224,noah is the compassionate leftist that we all need to be more like,5,1
225,why do half of these alfalfa boys feel the need to yell at the camera,1,1
226,every time a red pill alpha male talks about evolutionary psychology or gamifies dating women it gives me this weird feeling inside like men think women have this internal monologue constantly running telling them how to act around men what to do what to say instead of y know having normal thoughts of a normal person like any time a man talks to me my brain is running all these calculations about how much money i think he has and whether he ll be able to produce strong children or whatever the fuck it s just weird,5,1
227,i m new to your channel and was just feeling out the vibes for a few videos but man that tankie joke got me okay i m in,3,1
228,in the long run men are gonna marry who they want i m reasonably certain an overweight middle aged unemployed obnoxious dude is not gonna be able to marry a 22 year old supermodel also these guys are obsessed with marriage i get it but its kind of weird,3,1

232,that whole tom and jerry bit was cool but are we gonna ignore the fact that he said no big bro does he think his girlfriend is gonna cheat on him with her brother,3,0
233,that s not the same thing at all the guy who feels like he has to pay is not the same as the woman demanding the man pays it s the same as the analogy about expecting sex it s very lopsided both are influenced by the way society expects things to be but only one of them is benefiting from it i understand that it s because of the patriarcy but it s not the same,2,1
234,to all the guys hating on red pill ask yourself this question does the creator of this video look like he d ever have a chance of sleeping with a 9 or 10 case closed,1,1

242,why is the camera angle for 75 of these dudes straight up the nose holes,1,0
243,i d really love to see you cover this topic from the flip side though if you really wanted to make a great video that stands out make one about good guys who do a great job showing how to talk to women talk to different men about how to field and what s appropriate in different environments there s a ton of content to go into lots of guys desperate to hear it and you d be doing a wholesome service that fits with your base,4,1
244,look man if you need fucking tutorials on how to talk to women then you have to be working on a lot more stuff it s simple talk to women like they re humans like you re equals,3,2

247,i am a late gen xer on millenial cusp i was always under the impression if a guy asked me to dinner or to see a band or movie especially if i was broke would make a little joke that i thought it was great but couldn t afford it which was the truth because i didn t want them to expect i thought they had to pay some guys would be a little hurt bc they wanted to take me on a great day i m an empath as well guess as a human it sucks to be nice,2,1

254,i know this is besides the point but what makes the most sense to me is whoever asked the other out pays also splitting the check to me personally is strange but i honestly think that i think like this bc i m mexican and food is a major bonding point so people fight over who s gonna pay the check in whole,3,1

258,caroline i feel ya i have no idea,3,0
259,the thing with the paying for dates is that it s from back in the day when women didn t have money of their own so obviously the guy payed,1,1
260,not completely and it s paid lol,1,0
261,very good i will probably subscribe,4,0
262,i think that the man should pay for the date but by the man i mean the patriarchy,3,1
263,right first off anytime a man speaks about his feelings they are used against him and no one gives a shyt anyway so why bother any time i have opened up to another person i have always regretted it later secondly about the whole relationship thing not everyone is even meant for relationships if people want to live their own life how they like for their own reasons what business is it of anybody else s lastly we have reached the point where true understanding and compromise is impossible and i have resolved to simply stop caring about things that don t affect me personally doesn t affect me then not my problem popcorn,1,1
264,maybe find better people to be around me my family my friends and my lover talk about our feelings a lot and it gets personal often and at times dark dont blame society like this when its clear that the people around you aren t healthy and or mature enough to have these types of talks,3,1
265,it s such a stupid thing to say that women don t marry who they want that s not even slightly true not even a bit this isn t 1889 women don t have to marry who we are told to anymore men ask typically and we say yes or not men are still the ones doing most of the asking for sex and for marriage we are still the ones answering their request,1,1
266,have you tried to roast them red piller live myron is doing a podcast every week or so or have you tried debating better bachelor or steven crowder perhaps or christina h picking at some low hanging fruits from tik toks doesn t make you any better as a matter of fact this is the same behavior as them pick a random video and start ranting and never give them a chance to reply or defend their points all this really does is virtue signaling to females and appeal to their vanity quite disingenuous really,1,1
267,i ve said this in some other videos of his it s why he been called out by some breadtube people noah is legit a part of the very problem,1,1
268,_ feeeemaaales _,5,0
269,the video was good until you said zelensky,2,2
270,lmfaooo the tom and jerry part definitely made me loose it,5,0
271,so i used to have a friend who had a crush on me and we were pretty close i didn t know she had feelings so i was oblivious the whole time but we were friends since middle school my boyfriend knew but didn t try to make me stop being friends with her we called eachother wife as a joke and he politely asked me not to do that but that s it he didn t say if you loved me you d drop her or anything ike that we eventually stopped being friends and he told me he trusted me so he didn t worry about it at all i love that guy,5,1
272,matthew is not red pill idk why you d include him,1,2
273,in the next part of matthew hussey s video he says that if a man doesn t offer to pay he wasn t raised right i ve seen people respond to the video more than once,1,1
274,that stupid quote about marriage and sex in men vs women is so dumb and makes you come to the only conclusion these guys wives are settling for them not the flex they think it is,1,1
275,do you ever think that this kind of roast the incels videos from bread tube only bring validation to the red pill manosphear fandom by validating the underdog image that they so often try to portray themselfs as,1,1
276,mwaa goodbye god no ah where was my consent for that one not in your earholes the nerve of this ma uh du um jerk anyway love you noah mwaa,1,0
277,and sadly there women who literally think like these men,1,1
278,the one who asks pays,5,0
279,if someone feels the need to control manipulate and emotionally damage another person they don t need to be in a relationship my husband and i fully respect each other and our emotions he never tried to control me at any point in our relationship and when it comes to our emotions both of us support each other and rely on each other for understanding we know we can come to each other when we are going through something i absolutely support men talking about their feelings and being open but this manosphere crap is really pushing a dangerous narrative i m a survivor of dv and sa and a lot of these tactics they are talking about are very similar and sometimes spot on with dv men shouldn t be watching these videos and thinking this is the way to act around women if you feel so insecure in a relationship that you feel you need to control every aspect of the woman s life then you are not ready to be in a relationship point blank,5,1
280,red pill you mean low intelligence squad,1,2
281,everything in the lives of these men is about women putting them down,5,1
282,submite to u basically she has to sell her soul to this fuck and not breath without asking him,1,1
283,wren is fucking genius monetize people s guilt lol,1,0
284,i find the mentality of being controlling towards your partner as a means to combat the potential they might cheat to be super extra insane in a way a lot of people don t often point out if your so would cheat on you if given the opportunity then your relationship is already deeply toxic and damaged it s a relationship that you should be able to acknowledge isn t working it s a relationship that you shouldn t want to continue you should always feel comfortable with trusting your partner around others and if you don t you should consider deeply why you feel that way,2,2
285,if she cannot submit to yewww and the things you want her to dewww shes not for yewww ok dr sewwws,2,2
286,noah where s the fucking kitty,1,0
287,i think the one good take in the other side is the guy talking about dating and who should pay if you go out with someone it d be nicer if everyone assumed they d be paying that way you both have that nice moment when you realize someone was willing to pay for your dinner if you just assume your food will be paid for it s kinda demeaning for the other person so maybe we all could just like not do that,3,1
288,hop goblin lol,4,0
289,someone peg these misogynists,1,0
290,25 43,3,0
291,20 58 where did this idea come from that men are supposed to pay the more i think about it the more i tend to think it came from a time where men made more money than women anyone else have any ideas or know where this came from,1,1
292,well you re mostly right men however still make more the gender pay gap was and still is a real thing however the further back you go the more difficult it was for a woman to be financially independent as recently as 1950 s america for instance women were often refused their own bank account either they were expected to have one gifted to them by a parent usually the father or expected to use their husband s this wasn t universally true of course but it was common enough that it gave rise to a whole pile of stereotypes and gender norms that persist to this day,3,1
293,18 10 why does he always emphasize the bitch like the margaret thatcher is dead video,1,0
294,the girl i m talking to is helping me get over a lot of past trauma by telling me i m not my past almost daily these dudes are just insecure fuckheads,1,1
295,1st dude if she does not submit to you everyone with a brain okay now hold your horses,1,2
296,from all us sarahs fuck you too noah jk,1,2
297,these guys are the exact type of guys that a majority of women and girls avoid at all cost,5,1
298,5 03 you do realize there are other toms and jerrys in the world right,5,2
299,seems clear to me that these men had a traumatic experience with girls and they are projecting their traumas and insecurities to the young tiktok audience as a person that really struggle dating i would like to say that even in frustration i try to have a balanced and rational perspective of the whole situation,4,1
300,personally i love being for the streets,5,0
301,i don t like it when men pay the tab for dates because it always feels like they expect something from me in return i always ask to split it on a first date,2,1
302,some darn good maplestoey,3,0
303,dude i love you videos so much,5,2
304,thanks for this btw,5,0
305,when i think about it why should men hide feelings from women when they probablyyy know how to deal w it better than us,3,1
306,i used to follow these guys a lot n watching this vid now makes me realize that it was probablyyy just me being insecure n lonely and never feeling the touch of a woman,2,1
307,so that s pretty poggers,3,0
308,i really noticed all the shiz that men get for being something more than a robotic wallet when i came out as a trans guy it hurts especially since people will use anything that i do that isn t hyper masculine as an excuse to say i m not trans enough,2,1
309,i like u make fun of people who dont think the same as u do noah i bet u get triggered for the fact there are men who dont want chicks who has participated in hookup culture then again its a free world and some simps wont mind but some people do however i think its way better being honest with yourself and having a serious discussion with one self and make up your mind on certain topics and not be group pressured into believing something one does not believe in of course that also comes with not hating on people who believes the opposite u do i dont want a chick that sleept with anyone cuz im a vrigin and so i expect my gf to be aswell im not gonna change that standard for literally besides dont give me the crap about not being sexually compatible i think i comes down to both parties being honest again and a clear communication i just think its honestly sad too see u make fun of everything however shows me no personality wheres your thoughts on this and that got none i mean u cant be serious for even a second its really sad too afraid of upsetting ur fan base or what like come one man grow a pair and say something u agree with the opposite instead of always disagreeing it makes no sense cuz it seems like u believe in either black or white and that conecpt exludes the grey parts in the world that exists i honestly get triggered when people like u dont even try to have a serious discussion just gaslighting and strawmaning every agrument someone puts on the table this worlds sucks ass but mostly the women do,4,1

312,lovely stash bro,5,0
313,that amazon forest project is amazing i just needed to say that definitely gonna check out wren,5,0
314,despite everything i think this kind of response is valuable sure some of these men are too far gone to be affected but coherently laying down exactly how with so much patience can only be good for people on a healthier path we all have a lot to work on and hearing this helps counter the normalization of harmful views,4,1
315,care more is an interesting concept of itself we had to have this discussion my husband and i i feel my emotions more than others and he feels them less than others we like to think of it as having different health bars from video games i have a larger health bar than him so while my love is more as in stronger we love each other with the same percentage rate of our health bar although his health bar is smaller than others he is an amazing and thoughtful life partner and friend,5,1

323,btw for the hitler made good art angle just a reminder he fully lacked understanding of perspective he would just draw what he saw,3,0
324,right off the bat with the first video i hope that women who interact with these types of men know that they too are not for them they don t have to change themself or be less than to be with someone because there are mature men with more open mindsets out there i know our ability to comprehend differs per individual but i honestly had no clue there were so many men and women who had no idea what a healthy relationship looked like,1,1
325,the last guy who was all about paying for date is disgusting me if he s asking for sex in return for his paying what if woman paying for the date and she should ask for return i wish someone asked him this,1,1
326,at that point why not just pay a sex worker lol,1,0
327,it s fair so wth are you saying,3,2
328,did that guy say no big bro sir are you ok edit oh ok it got worse,2,2
329,i pray no woman has to go through such a controlling relationship forcing such extreme change upon someone is the base formula for a disaster,1,0
330,the funniest thing about all of these loser dudes giving dating advice is that they re giving it to men already struggling to find dates and telling them to do things that will make them even less dateable then of course they assume it s the fault of women and not their own terrible behavior and beliefs unless you find a girl with really low self esteem which we do know they re looking for sadly because they can t handle anything else she s not going to date you she has plenty of other options,5,1
331,honestly we really need to drop the men should pay bulls it it s been hurting our case long enough and there is no basis or excuse for it i ve never once let a date pay for me unless i know i can get them back next time then again _all_ of this feels pretty the straights are at it again,1,1

347,you comedy is top notch ngl,5,2
348,lol funnily enough due to my own experiences and upbringing i would honestly say that with my ex that i didn t care as much as she did as a self defense mechanism and engrained machismo and god was that terrible for our relationship eventually definitely was a huge factor in us splitting up this lean of mine towards indifference rather than caring exacerbated her own insecurities haha this is terrible advice,1,1
349,the issue i ve found is that when i pay for my part a majority of the men i date feel emasculated which i guess is better to learn early however when i let them pay they feel entitled to my body it s like i m damned if i do damned if i don t,3,1
350,you can t win out here,5,2
351,save yourself a step here if they can t get to the place where they feel entitled to your body they feel emasculated picking up the check is just an excuse,1,1

356,one thing that will never fail to be funny to me is all the incels alpha males that flock to these videos to tell women like me what our dating preferences are imagine being that clueless word of advice no one knows what women want better than other women and every woman is different instead of listening to bad misogynistic takes why don t you talk to the women you re close to and get to genuinely know them on a deep and personal level learn what they re looking for in a partner and if you re compatible with their wants and needs shoot your shot,5,1
357,if dating a woman is so bad why dont they just date men,1,1
358,because they re not attracted to them i m assuming,3,1

375,your edits are funny af,5,0
376,these people are genuinely terrifying thanks for talking abt this another banger,5,0
377,in a hilarious twist of irony i think the specific kind of self hatred i possess kept me from being pulled into the incel worldview i check every demographic box on their target audience but every time i encounter their content i just sort of thought oh so that s why no women want me damn their smart good for them honestly and then went on with my life like normal,2,1
378,with the whole who pays for the date argument i think that you should either split the bill or whoever asked the other on the date they should pay,1,1
379,hmm the empath style no i rather not but that s just my 2 cents,2,0
380,there is much more to it than just choosing empath or asshole,2,0
381,does this mean noah is a simp according to redpillers,3,0
382,there s like a massive issue in the biology community i think that unfortunately helps play into this way of thinking animal behaviorists often liken how animals choose mates to how humans go about dating and they try way too hard to explain away all human dating behaviors as biologically inherent while some of them certainly are like dressing nicely for a date there s a lot that aren t and are just a product of how the society we ve built is structured those can t really be explained with biology but a lot of biologists do their hardest to try so when biologists are out here saying oh women will go after men who are older and have more money because they need a male to provide for them because biology redpill guys will absolutely eat that up it s a viewpoint that is really centered around how men feel in a patriarchal society and fails to capture any nuance in human dating or the reality of human lifestyles men aren t the only ones who put on a show for a potential partner s attention women do that too men aren t the only providers to a family women do that too it s just annoying how even biologists subscribe to this idea that a patriarchy exists for a reason and actively push for massively bioessentialist views on human behavior people might argue against this and say well something being biologically based doesn t necessarily mean it s okay and it s just a simple fact and yeah but think about what you are arguing for there that women are biologically just submissive and meek and peaceful and men are dominant and loud and violent and that s the truth that helps nobody and is transphobic and misogynistic but because it s biology people take it as fact and use as an excuse for shitty men s behavior and it just gives incels alpha male types more ammunition,3,1
383,why are they all black,1,0
384,why do you think that s a relevant pattern,3,2
385,women in comment section getting offended this guys are just spitting facts,1,0
386,a man paying for a date is out of a few bucks a woman having sex with a man exposes herself to unwanted pregnancy which men bail on all the time so the comparison is not weighted the same at all yet many men think if they re expected to pay that they re entitled to sex immediately i still expect any man i entertain to pay but it s not a guarantee for sex i also believe in meeting their needs if it s not too much according to my own standards both parties have the right to have certain standards there s no way i ll ever date a man who won t pay in the beginning cuz that s how i feel the interest,1,1
387,can we please stop calling them men they are boys toddlers at best,1,0

400,i just wanna say that i really appreciate your videos there are very few men out there who are up to the task of bringing up the patriarchy the red pill and misogyny especially in a way that not only explains it but also provides a helpful male view it s definitely not an easy task but it s legit so needed right now props to you,4,1

407,has anyone seen my vagina bruh we aren t legitimately going to submit you re not suppoused to be serious and the look of every guy who says this to boot,1,1
408,i don t agree that men should always pay at all but pay for a date or there is no date is different than consent to sex or i will force it on you like how can those things even be compared,1,1
409,the best part about the restore dislikes plugin is that i can easily find out that 317 redpill guys watched this video and smashed their impotent fists against their desks knocking over their jordan peterson busts and causing their barstool hats to fly off their heads before mashing the dislike button,1,1
410,wow so funny,5,0
411,perhaps the sun s uv rays will disinfect these lumps of misogyny toe jam once noah has finished dragging them out into daylight,1,0
412,whomever asked to go out is typically the one that should pay if i ask someone out i would pay for the date if i get asked out the person that asked me should pay splitting is fine as long as you have communicated this when making the plans so nobody is unprepared without money honestly it shouldn t be that hard or that big of a deal,3,1
413,and who mostly does the asking men usually women are mostly passive daters you look like an attractive woman ill assume youve been asked out plenty and dont really have to ask out dudes if you want to but that is not mens reality if i dont approach or ask out women i will remain lonely even if im good looking plus not to mention that men who are socially dominant and lead and plan dates are seen as more attractive so i could say lets split or ask the woman where she wants to go but that wont make me seem attractive it should be that whoever asks out but it will still fall on men regardless,3,1
414,i actually do have a very reasonable answer to the who pays for the date question _whoever invites the other person s on the date is the one that pays_ so if you ask someone s out on a date it s understood that you re paying for the date and vise versa that way it stays pretty even throughout the relationship and eventually paying for the date will be seen as a romantic gesture it ll also still allow you your partner s to go on dates even if one of you is short on cash that month,4,1
415,wait hold on i just realised you re the editor for noel s channel lol,1,2

421,someone calling mathew hussey out wow this guy has a huge platform on dating advice for women and has been called for interviews on pro feminist channels like women of impact this guy is a women s dating coach and he just spreads poison he incentivates women to go after men he incentivates women to keep chasing after being rejected ghosted tells women to pay for the bill and provide seggs i remember him scolding a woman who was dating a guy and found out he was married so she exposed the dude to his wife mathew wanted to bite the woman s head off because the guy being married was not her problem and she was acting out of jealously,1,1
422,who pays for the date whoevers idea it was that s how babe and i do it which leads to sometimes i buy sometimes she buys depending on who has the money to spare at the time,3,1
423,redpill is really just working on youself to improve in as many areas as possible its not what 99 of the tiktoks in this video where just hating women,1,1
424,true and that isn t a bad thing becoming what you see as a better version of yourself is objectively good but it s mostly the motivations behind it the red pill originated on 4chan where it was used to describe a hierarchy of men where only the ones at the top get to be laid because something something women whoes as it quite evident if you search up red pill content most people that talk about it still believe that and spread that bs it hurts both men and women to see each other in competition if the entire goal is to find someone to make you happy,3,1

434,i really don t get the who pays for the date debate is this an american thing where i m from we argue in a kinda ritualistic manner about who gets to invite who as soon as the bill arrives eventually somebody concedes but only under the condition that he gets to pay next time not only on dates but in general everything else would seem kinda rude,2,1

441,usually my tip for the alpha bros is to date women they like who also like them it seems they ve never tried it,3,1
442,i actually watched the entire ad because i started to feel nauseous with what he said i m going to go get some ginger ale so i can stomach this entire video so disgusting,1,0
443,i dont like how you mock these guys they need help and love but get rejected by society in so many ways they just feel hopeless including a video like this we should help them instead of mocking or debunking them i too was almost an incel beta and was at a really dark place i now try to help these guys to get out of it and get goals in their life there are way more societal problems going on with the incels and male loneliness bit just mocking and debunking them like this is just a tip of the iceberg,1,1
444,they all clearly watched read waaayyyyy too much 50 shades of gray grey,1,0
445,i saw the british guy at 1 05 and was surprised i thought he was a dating coach for women and i used to watch his stuff but i guess he went down that path don t remember his name though i also just realized i have the same wolf poster that the tom and jerry guy has in the background ooof for me i guess also i think that when your partner cannot express their emotions it just makes you feel guilty for expressing your emotions anyone who has any emotional maturity knows this i do feel bad for men that they have to be strong all the time when that is impossible you have to have someone to lean on from time to time and that absolutely needs to be normalized like yesterday and oh boy they brought up the whole women can fool around when they re young but not as they age bs these guys actually think that they get bette with age from where it s like they don t listen to women oh that s right they don t also if the person i m out with is more concerned about who is paying for the date than actually getting to know each other then i m not going on a second date i think coming to the realization that heteronormative people are obsessed with this made me 100 for just going dutch a date is about looking for a future partner that you can relate with it s not about bs narratives about who should do what equal is fair and no i don t want someone thinking they can hold that over me and say that i owe them screw that noise,2,1
446,i mean this in the most constructive way possible very little of this was debunking and it s largely taking obtuse interpretations of what the red piller says while giving armchair psychological analysis of the content creator then of course deriding the red pill opinion i m only commenting because you quoted bell hooks on how society enforces patriarchy including feminists while essentially doing the same thing last note while i disagree by and large with much of what the red pill guys say they re note wrong all the time for instance yes you actually do appear better to people if you avoid gossip and can compliment adversaries that s bde but he was wrong in creating a technique out of it that s not how that works and you were wrong in being obtuse as if he was saying a man should avoid giving genuine criticism when it s important to do so he legit said gossip anywho i actually love your content i just think you could benefit from being more persuasive and less preaching to the choir,2,1
447,what i took from this is that tom and jerry must be stopped because they banged my partner too,5,0
448,what happened in these men s childhoods to hate themselves and women so much,5,1

464,idk if it s pretty privilege or what but i subscribed right away,3,0
465,at first i was not a samsen fan because i thought his comedy was a bit too derivative of tim and eric awesome show great job but it s definitely grown on me i enjoy the content and am glad to see him addressing unhealthy ideologies and rhetoric in a lighthearted way i particularly like to see him quoting authors who have written more extensively about the topic rather than just sharing his own thoughts and opinions on the matter i d like to see him continue to grow in that regard,4,1
466,for the love of god if you are with someone that you feel like you have to hover over them then don t be in the relationship,5,2
467,what about their bs has to be debunked no offense meant but that s like debunking creationists sure you can do it it s easy but in the end any sane person will see right through their ramblings while everyone who doesn t spot their cap is too far gone to be impressed by stating facts,3,1
468,i pretty much agree with this but i can t think of how else to deal with the fact that these channels continue to grow and appeal to a lot of young men like ignoring this problem won t make it go away that s just my reasoning at least,3,1

496,and i saw the dead small and great standing before god and books were opened and another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged according to their works by the things which were written in the books the sea gave up the dead who were in it and death and hades delivered up the dead who were in them and they were judged each one according to his works then death and hades were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death and anyone not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire revelation 20 12 15 nkjv today while you are still alive and able may you repent from your sins believe in your heart and confess with your mouth that jesus christ is your lord and savior so that through him your name will be written in the book of life for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting life for god did not send his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved john 3 16 17 nkjv god loves you jesus died for you please remember that,5,1

506,the amount of people who take the whole women must submit to men thing from the bible pisses me off so much it doesn t mean she s your little slave who you control lest they ignore forget ephesians 5 28 in the same way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies it also talks about how the man is the head of the woman but in the same way that jesus is the head lead of his congregation he s a leader and protector not a controller it s not a dictatorship also men be someone who is worth submitting to be someone she can trust and rely on know how to do your own laundry i know for a fact that if i end up falling for some great guy there s going to be times where i ll let him do what he wants with me but that is only because we d agree to that i m in the mood for it up for it and i love him so much that it would be good for me anyway and we d have a safe word code tap out and he d stop if i end up wanting to marital rape is a thing also for goodness sake how insecure are you that i can t be with guy friends i ve personally always had either equal amounts of boy girl friends or more guy friends than girl friends i m not going to stop being friends with people i ve known longer than you just bc you need therapy lol the whole section 22 let wives be in subjection to their husbands as to the lord 23 because a husband is head of his wife just as the christ is head of the congregation he being a savior of this body 24 in fact as the congregation is in subjection to the christ wives should also be to their husbands in everything 25 husbands continue loving your wives just as the christ also loved the congregation and gave himself up for it 26 in order that he might sanctify it cleansing it with the bath of water by means of the word 27 so that he might present the congregation to himself in its splendor without a spot or a wrinkle or any of such things but holy and without blemish 28 in the same way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies a man who loves his wife loves himself 29 for no man ever hated his own body but he feeds and cherishes it just as the christ does the congregation 30 because we are members of his body 31 for this reason a man will leave his father and his mother and he will stick to his wife and the two will be one flesh,1,1

515,whoever asks the person out on the date should pay if you invite someone on a date why would they pay it was your idea or whatever,1,1
516,normally would totally agree but as someone who was invited out by a guy he insisted on paying and when i didn t express interest in sleeping with or continuing to date him he flipped his lid called me horrible names and told me i owed him money when dating my current bf i refused to let him pay for me even if he invited me out,1,1
517,these dudes hate women so much and yet make their whole personality appealing to women,5,1
518,i feel like these ideas are too old to be accepted today i showed this to my brother and he said you can t fight these guys you gotta challenge them to a duel,2,2

526,this was posted on my birthday oh yeah good shit subscribed,1,0
527,11 30 i would disagree that the counter content is specific for one major reason there are no real alternative communities offered that s important because a lot of men fall into redpill communities since it s one they feel prioritized in of course a lot of bad advice is tossed around but the lonely audience these guys appeal to isn t going to be swayed by just treat women well most women aren t like this this is a result of the patriarchy that you should be working to dismantle or stop focusing so much on relationships because many of them feel such thinkings already haven t gotten them anywhere they essentially view videos like those as whataboutism because the people making them don t prioritize tangible steps and solutions to men s issues as opposed to telling them why the redpill is toxic it s of course important to say why redpillers and their beliefs are toxic but until these kinds of videos prioritize alternative solutions and communities where men are prioritized i think they ll remain unconvinced,2,1
528,i disagree there doesn t have to be an alternate solution bc men are not simply entitled to sex or a relationship just like no woman is simply entitled to sex or a relationship with men women are not obligated to give anybody a chance sorry but there is no moral alternative solution to that these guys need to just get over their sense of entitlement they are not owed anything from women,2,1
529,no bisexual lighting,2,0
530,the argument is women can sleep with who they wish to has overt flaws some quantifiable and the others quantifiable if i may sleep with whomever i wish then that man is also sleeping with who he wishes to sleep with unless the argument is that men are constantly assaulted by women who force them into sex sex requires two people everyone is relegated to intimacy based on access availability and their willingness to participate there are amazingly beautiful and kind women all over the world however they are still limited by their access to and the willingness of the objects of their attractions to be mutually invested in pursuing them what their arguments seem to be is that men have no agency another problem half of these videos drone on about is all of women who are for the streets which precludes their desire to be with those women therefore those women do not have access to them per their own admission so both cannot be true so women can sleep with whomever they want just not them but the man who she is having sex must be an unwilling participant as only the woman is with who she wants to be with unless you are over weight over 26 years old had any previous relationships a child or childhood male friends also submission is intrinsic to compromise something everyone does in any relationship both parties will submit depending on each other s stake in the outcome they do not want submission they want ownership over someone else s existence lastly men do express emotion all the time these manosphere videos are all highly emotional you see insecurity sadness pain jealousy hurt anger and all sorts of feelings even if their affect is incongruent with these emotions the words are you do not need to physically cry to express pain or sadness all i see when i watch this stuff is insecurity hurt and pain described by people ill equipped to manage it even if they had a woman to do everything they said it wouldn t be enough because what they are missing cannot be filled with another person no one can make you happy rather you share your happiness with each other or they do not supress your ability to be happy meaning individually happy people are more successful at relationships than people who expect to be made happy through their partner s behaviours you may be happy with your relationship but it should not be because of it that is too much pressure and an unfair delegation of responsibility to the other party it is why compatibility is paramount because you will have more things which you both find happiness in together without having to be uncomfortable for the sake of each other s happiness if all of the women or men you encounter all end the same you re the constant meaning 20 different people from different life experiences met you but your dissatisfaction remains the same then the probability favours you being the catalyst for the 20 negative outcomes not the twenty other people or you should gamble,3,1
531,the obsession men have with submission is absolutely disgusting and disturbing marriage is a contract no doubt but it isn t a slave contract submission is a very strong word it removes and destroys the possiblity of having an identity the humanistic right to be a free human who has ideas opinions at times i believe men don t even know the true meaning of submission it just seems they want someone who worships them and does whatever they want it thank god i am a muslim woman who knows her rights in islam where men can t throw this submission bullshit into my face i submit only to god,1,1

553,this might be controversial but imo most of the time the guy should pay for the date the gender pay gap still exists and it costs a lot more to be a woman think bras sanitary products makeup getting waxed getting your nails done etc we are also risking a lot more in terms of safety by going on the date once we earn the same ammount all these other patriarchal expectations are dropped like shaving etc and date rape scenarios aren t as common anymore then splitting will start so seem fair otherwise it just seems like we re starting the change by taking away the few privileges women had whilst fixing none of the issues,2,1

555,i find it so funny that these men say women have all the power because they can fuck whoever they want and in the same breath they will list a hundred mysoginistic red flags like if i ever wanted to have sex with fresh and fit god forbid i would never i can 100 assure you he would not want to have sex with me because like i m not a virgin i m a leftist i can legally drink i have male friends i m on instagram take your pick,5,1
556,i have 4 tom s and a dwindling community of jerry s because of my said tom s and i don t let my wife know about the jerry s because i don t want her to get skeeved out about jerry s coming uninvited into our home jk i don t tell her because i don t want her to fuck the jerry s because she s a woman so she s barely a human and definitely not as important as me because i have a wiener jk alpha male and red pill dudes are silly to say the least it s honestly sad people believe these goons,1,1
557,these alpha guys all have such beta energy it s weird they re like don t compare me to your other partners and if you know any other men at all you ll definitely leave me for them and don t care too much or you re not a man but at the same time they care so much that they re afraid to let their partner outside the house yet they brag about this stuff as though it s not hella embarrassing to admit it just goes right over my head i m afraid they need to work on their self confidence because they clearly doubt their ability to please and keep a womenfolk,5,1

576,what thank you so much noah for bringing those topics to light and make it more comprehensive for the average non alpha population but what kidding you re very insightful and i know very well that patriarchy misogyny and men having feelings have been issues since the dawn of human societies i m just always so disturbed and distraught each time i realize such behaviors and opinions have open platforms to flourish but it always make me happy when you and other content creators of quality make videos on topics like this just hope that not all your audience is constitute of people already aware and sensibilized to these issues and that your videos actually help to open the eyes of people having such toxic views 17 43 _enjoy_,5,1
577,tell me you haven t touched a woman since high school with out telling me vibes from the dudes in these videos how do they get through their day with thoughts like this,5,1
578,wait you and these weak women and weak guys on this channel are so far gone there s sooooo much tragic disgusting horrible things many not all but tons of women have done and the similarities common occurrences same exact things that many women have done to men and some of us are aware now look at tik tok idiot girls straight up saying the grimy stuff they do the entitlement i guarantee you the majority of women on here agree with this mislead guy only because they re women no responsibility for what many women have done ya all are just against any man that states the horrible things many women do and how they operate in the total red pill is to help men be careful it s to educate it s i don t know prevent suicides most suicides are from men but you can pretend you didn t just read that and pretend you can t look up that statistic majority not all of women today are demonstrating these detestable ways of thinking and acting its extremely nervy of you to belittle men for wanting to be safe not lose all their money because courts always side with the women it s pathetic how you and these followers completely don t care for the guys trying to be safe and educated you care about women what about the guy who was cheated on and the girl had a kid with the other guy and the courts made him pay for the kid of the other guy yall missing tons of information now if there are guys who are going with red pill just to get laid or they re knowingly with a toxic girl and are trying to navigate by learning red pill that i disagree with those types of red pill guys are douschbags i m speaking for what i said prior oh by the way so you re saying men should automatically pay for the meal women like that are self entitled and take a nice gesture for granted if i go on a date i don t want it automatically assumed i m paying for her is she my daughter treat her like a kid what about how women can make money themselves i think if they re independent it s actually offensive to assume the guy will pay hmmm i m not saying all men are good either but you people on here are missing too much but some red pill guys have a lot of wisdom and can help but some of them aren t discouraging to stay away from bad women that with some of the red pill is pathetic btw to anyone that thinks i m just a bitter guy who mistreated my girl and now i m saying all this nope i don t have to social media showed all this many women have demonstrated this it out also the girls on this channel just hate the fact that there s women that misrepresent you so you ll just target men who call you out on it instead of thinking maybe those guys are right not about me though that s all but thar requires a tad of humility which obviously a lot of you girls lost or don t have because your ex banged a better looking girl but after reading this there s still going to be no acknowledgement on your actions and it s just men,1,1
579,you keep bringing up very vague anecdotal examples which kinda points to your redpill take being guided by feelings rather than a decent factual analysis on the gender dynamics in this society you genuinely seem hurt which pains me but your hurt is greatly misdirected really all i can ask from you is to simply exercise empathy and to see men and women as human as one team facing a fucked up muddled world as opposed to men vs women constantly accusing the other of creating this fucked up world,2,1

588,i ve been vaguely aware from very early on that if i let a man pay on a date for drink food coffee there is an expectation of paying back in some other way like by playing nice maybe some physical touch and ofc the sex and i decided to always pay for my own shit the countless times i ve had to defend myself and my right to pay for my own damn order is ridiculous oh do you know how emasculating that is that is not very ladylike don t you trust me are you afraid that imma f you disgusting but also very telling about persons expectations,1,1

600,my only criticism of this video is that the matthew hussey video was take out of context if u finish that entire video he actually puts those women in their place and tells them how unreasonable it is how much they are expecting from men they just met he also says there s nothing wrong for women paying on a date again my only criticism bc he does hold women accountable,4,1
601,that video was definitely not taken out of context side note people who say something was taken out of context are usually incorrect and trying to cover their ass because they don t like being called out for the bad worldviews they put out for everyone to see,1,1

604,i hate the whole if he pays she needs to give up bodily autonomy thing i generally like to pay for myself whether with friends or on a date simply because i don t like feeling like a burden but i happily pay for others from time to time when i can afford it because i want them to be able to participate and it s how i show i care it never has to do with expecting something in return and anyone who offers something and then expects something in return which was never agreed upon is gross people like that are difficult because they see the world as black and white with no grey areas but relationships are individual there s no steadfast rule for who should pay or how much sex to have or who should take out the trash because all partnerships are slightly different,1,1

627,so now u keep coming up on my feed because i watched isaac do a response on your response of him i am only 2 minutes into your video so i probably should watch more before i write something but i m really sick atm so i probably won t watch much more of this video so todd i want to know why it s cool to speak poorly about males u don t knoah anything about except a short video clip of yes that was a lame joke but probably better than todd s when isaac speaks out about people eating themselves to death that is a good cause body positivity is good for people that can t change what they are stuck born with not for people that are purposely giving themselves heart attacks and diabetes just like in reverse being anorexic is also very bad i think it s because your either two things it s because when isaac spoke on woman your possibly so far left that u have came around to the right side without even realizing it or u think u will get viewers money possibly puss if that s what your even into for following the p c culture i think this is the 2nd or 3rd video i have seen of u and all i can say is p c is bad for business then knoah one will want to watch but good luck with your channel and if u want to try and change the world u need to speak on there level and let them decide for themselves to change in my opinon i don t really think u do want to change the world for the best i think u just want money or clout and i do hope if u make it that u don t find yourself lonely at the top because that s where alot of people find themself when they reach that spot people may need to watch isaac butterfield to understand what im talking about and why i m calling him todd,2,1
628,lol racist much his australian and i do like his belief even if people don t understand how he explains himself i was once very under weight and got alot of judgment over it i won t go to deep into it but it made me workout and over eat to not be seen in that light by about a year after i became over weight for my height i thought i was only having anxiety but when i finally went to the doctors they informed me that i was having angina attacks that were turning into mini heart attacks i was very lucky to get this information in time so i could change my eating habits after about another 12 months this had changed me for the best i felt great and now am able to spend more time with my children without having a heart attack and dying on them it s a great message and just because i want to eat crappy foods shouldn t fall on the out come of my loved ones if me liking this message means i m simping for isaac then i m a simp lol,3,1

631,it often feels as if these men are bitter and resentful towards women being able to express their emotions more freely and openly than men are my brother in christ other men decided this was the way things had to be not women isn t it usually the older generations of men that have passed these attitudes down from grandfather to father to son when women share these views isn t that often because the societal standards influence them just as much as men besides it s not even true that women are allowed to express themselves more freely anyway so often we are derided and belittled for being emotional and are dismissed because of it,2,1

671,7 37 well no because when people tell hurt men to go to therapy what they really mean is you re weak your emotions aren t valid i m mocking you you re pathetic it s what we call a quadruple entendre i mean seriously do you really think that on the left the same left that will relentlessly bully you on twitter over fucking neo pronouns really gives a shit if we go to therapy or not,1,2
672,um you ll probably not read this since i am two weeks late to this comment but i am someone studying to be a psychologist and i literally say that to everyone when i see that they might need guidance to work through their issues the fact that you think that me saying that is invalidating your feeling and calling you pathetic shows me your opinion on therapy i think its a powerful thing to go to therapy it takes a lot to actively work on yourself sometimes you alone is not enough and thats okay i just want you to know that there are people out there who say statements like go to therapy because they genuinely want you to heal and work through what hurts you i won t lie to you that there are many communication barriers in society today and it sucks but i have some advice for you if someone says this to you and you think they might be invalidating you say that to them and ask them to clarify to you if that is not their intent therapy is an amazing resource especially when you find the right therapist for you which might take time but who said working on yourself is easy i just want you to know too that your feelings are valid and therefore you should be open to expressing them in order to understand the intent of a person i get taught this a bunch in school about the importance of separating intent vs impact because you might not intend to cause harm when you say something but that doesn t take away from the fact that the things you said hurt someone else i can talk about the problems with communication for hours but yeah i just felt like saying my piece i hope one day therapy can help you as much as it has helped me which is why i went on this rant if you got to this point thanks for tuning into my ted talk,3,2
673,this is sad watching a bunch of men with no experience with women talking about the one thing they can t understand honestly these men must have been hurt pretty freaking deeply to have this pathetic worldview,1,1

678,i m not even religious more traditional though and that s what i wanted,3,0
679,this is so common in my culture men with heaps of past relationships wanting to settle down for a pure woman who hasn t been with anyone before,5,1
680,my religion requires both men and women to be pious and not having relationship before marriage so if my husband wants me to be pure i too would definitely want him to be pure too,3,1

684,i met my wife in high school i kept telling her how much of an insecure loser i thought i was she said it didn t matter still loved me we ve been married for 14 years and going strong it s ok to talk about insecurities with the right partner i promise,3,1
685,yep just like when it s right getting to know someone you like who likes you back is super fucking easy none of these mind games or superficialities,1,2
686,that s only if you have already build up a solid foundation though i don t think it s attractive to already talk about insecurities when you just met someone,3,2
687,i also knew my husband in highschool but we didn t date until college we started off as good friends and built a strong foundation of trust before we finally pursued each other romantically he is especially in touch with his emotions and has never been afraid to share them with me we dated for 8 months before agreeing to marry and we ve been inseparable ever since i think more men just need to be more honest and willing to share their emotions to form deeper relationships too many people are looking for quick hookups now which almost always ends in dissapointment true love takes time and effort,5,1

701,man i remember when in an ice cream parlor there was a couple ahead of us in line and the woman paid for both ice creams and the woman who attended like congratulated her saying that we had to remove that idea that men had to pay for everything and it was turn of women to invite stuff too or something along the lines,1,1
702,women will marry who they can and men will marry who they want so is the implication here that when the men marry who they want the woman they re marrying don t want them,3,1

706,the chill lofi christian music playing behind the guy saying you care too much about the b tch is really the icing on the cake for me,4,1
707,despite my disagreement with the red pill community many of their statements are valid only when in contact with toxic females and the strategies that they present are usually use for men who have little to no experience with women or have a very negative response where they have a high experience with negative females the community perpetuates stigma which leads men to actually openly seek out the women that they complain about because they seem more genuine in the same way women choose to guys who are assholes because they have a perceived notion in their head that most men are assholes but they re just hiding it both sides are hurt,2,1
708,men i hate it when women give up sex so freely also men goes to a strip club men sex workers are awful people who should be ashamed of themselves also men logs on to the hub 10 seconds later i really don t understand how they can be so contradictory they literally support the women they supposedly have problems with they re like if someone said i don t like it when people do drugs and then goes out on a street corner to sell crack they re literally the source of their own problems strip clubs brothels sex work phub would not exist if it weren t for men and their lust but no its all women s fault,1,1
709,we live in a society that if you tell women there actions are not very good for relationships or marriages you will be called a misogynist and then you wonder why men are not taking a lot of you women seriously i doubt noah samson will ever have a debate with one of these red pill content creators who have statistics and everything and can show you how much the dating game and women behavior have changed ever since the introduction of social media in the late 2000s and early 2010s men simply do not hate women men have just adapted to the game and will not be manipulated by the mind games some of these women play,1,1
710,lol dude litteraly said we live in a society has to be a troll,1,0
711,see what i mean so many of these dudes literally tell young boys that woman play mind games and are manipulative due to their own experience instead of giving an actual lesson,1,1
712,that s because have of it is literally just saying woman should always be traditional submissive housewives that s the problem so please stop,1,1
713,i don t care what you do i wanna watch it,5,2
714,please please please do a video on what to do if a feminist is accused of being a man hater if she doesn t equally advocate for men s rights i can t find a good video for the life of me only women hating videos,1,1
715,i don t know of any video but this argument sees bizarre it implies that everyone who isn t actively advocating for a given cause is automatically and actively against it doesn t it,1,1
716,i am thankful i never fell for this clown sh1t even when i was in these circles and who is supposed to pay for the date it depends,5,1
717,i think who pays depends like very complex 1 you can t ask someone out and expect them to pay 2 your incomes should be taken into consideration like is one of you in full time employment while other is a university student is one of you mainteined by your parents 3 if you are a lesbian couple and a straight dude makes a threesome joke request he now is legally obligated to take you to the date if you want to and needs to shut up and pay,2,2
718,thanks for another banger noah love the videos every time you release one,5,2

722,i am redpiller but hey imo you might be in abusive relationship maybe try moving back in with parents to get away from him or you could just break up with him even though i know it might not be easy,3,2

728,the maplestory music took me on a really aggressive flashback that i wasn t prepared for tysm,2,0
729,i paid for one of your meals today so i get your body it just doesn t make sense how they don t see that as a trap is beyond me i can t think of another situation where that mindset would be ok if it was that important it d be discussed beforehand but you ll also find they tend to just leave it unsaid until the bill is paid well after the time that you can opt out gracefully every girl i personally know would either split or not let the guy pay because they feel like they re obligated to do something in return and don t want that what s funny is that there s a lot of guys who react negatively when hearing split check and that s a bad look but among friends it s normally the party that invites is the one that pays and that s to avoid split check hassle if we re offered a split we take it this is just between my husband and i another couple we re friends with and we ve talked about how we probably have equaled out in paid bills after all these years of mutual i ll treat tonight dinners no wife swapping needed,3,1
730,or or maybe everyone should pay for what they eat drink why do people pay for others aren t you on a date to get to know the person you re with why should they pay for you just because they asked you out didn t you accept to go on that date because you were interested as well or are you doing them a favour on going to the date so they sould pay you not talking about you but in general i just don t get how it s not how everyone operates it seems so logical and basic for example when i asked my friends if they want to go eat to a new restaurant they don t expext me to pay for them so i don t get they idea that someone has to pay for your meal,2,2

751,the answer to the who should pay question is whoever asked to go on the date if i asked you out i should be expected to pay,1,1
752,i think i have the perfect answer for the who should pay for the date question who proposed the date if it s your idea you pay for it i remember many times in my younger and poorer days asking a friend if they wanted to go grab lunch or dinner and them responding with i can t afford it my response was always i didn t ask if you can afford it i asked if you wanted to the man generally plans the first date in heterosexual relationships so yeah they should be expected to pay don t invite someone on an 1 on 1 excursion unless you plan on footing the bill it s about spending time with them don t make them consider finances when considering hanging out with you,5,1

756,i m struggling to see the problem,3,1
757,i think it makes the most sense for the person who asked to go on a date to also be the one to pay on a first date of course you can still decide to do it differently nothing wrong with splitting the bill either,4,1
758,red pill in a nutshell got hurt by a girl and rationalise it with toxicity narcissism and lack of self reflection then believe that they ve found the secret to all women black pill in a nutshell keeps getting rejected by women for utter lack of self awareness and or personal hygiene grooming and blames the world for being short and or ugly tired of these clowns,1,1
759,to be fair you can t deny that ugly people are treated horribly and are seen in a more negative way no matter what they do it s a bias that most if not all humans have they deserve empathy synpathy and deserve to be heard unless of course they start lashing out like most incels or at least a very vocal fraction of them do,2,1
760,just got my favorite moment of the day the first video of this guy played where he said something like if a woman cant completely submit to you and my phone slipped in my hand so i accidentally clicked on some random video that i must have started watching at some and it started playing somewhere in the middle with the amazingly fitting sentence and this might be the reason why you re still single im dead,5,1

765,in the relationship the person that cares more is always at a disadvantage that person is going to be used be her partner simply because the other one cares less the real question is how to make the other person care more the man should be attractive to get attention from other women so his girl should be always afraid he might leave for better hotter younger gal it is called the dread game and it is mostly passive you don t hit on every waitress at the restaurant it is actually desperate behavior you have to be attractive enough the other women will give you the look,2,1
766,this assumes that relationships must be zero sum and transactional which reflects more about you than people in general,5,2
767,_ even when you re in a relationship you must play this silly mind game _ your existence feels exhausting,5,2
768,is he recording behind an elementary school well you blue pill guys do like children s schools,5,2
769,meanwhile in any given incel redpill community it s natural for men to want to date much younger girls,3,1
770,you think alphas actually exist don t you,1,2
771,this comment says a lot about you,5,2
772,ask a dutch crowd who should pay and the answer is both the men and the woman get out a calculator and ask the waiter to split the bill into exactly who ate what,1,1
773,the memes in the intro is extra punny if you speak arabic,2,2
774,14 45 the guys speak truth women are the gatekeepers of _box_ and men are the gatekeepers of commitment any decent looking woman can have fun with virtually any guy she meets the guys are mostly rejected that is why we respect men who have the skill to _game_ multiple women and we don t respect women who were with many men bc for girls it requires no skill the real chellange for girls is not getting _box_ but getting relations high value man is most likely happy to score but he is not willing to offer the commitment the true man s power in the dating scene comes from offering the ring which they should never offer in the current legal system divorce law,2,1
775,these kind of sentiments are only valid if the women in question want to conform to traditional values and gender roles which is why such advice leaves so many redpill guys even more frustrated when they still do not find success bc all the logic and science used to support the redpill draws conclusions based on rigid assumptions about traditional values and gender roles often resulting in the redpill talking points drive young men towards even more radical and extreme ideology so a good example why the redpill ideology is not effective,2,1
