0,thanks for being an honest thinker russel its rare,5,0
1,what s interesting is that psychometrics also observes that critics of the scientific consensus of cliamre change tend to be individualistic pro corporations and anti government people who accept the consensus tend to be the opposite people rarely seem to make rational choices and are victims to their identities,3,1
2,2 15 the people who are the enemy of masculinity in men will also be the enemy of masculinity in women respectfully i d say this seems a bit oversimple when jung is right he s uncannily so other times it s like using legos for advanced architecture,3,1

18,like watching your older brother deep in conversation with your father what a legendary combo thanks for the top quality conversation russell,5,0
19,we have to disagree highly with peterson s assessment that masculine traits are also being suppressed in females many female characters in movies tv shows comics and video games have been de feminized which means their masculine traits are being emphasized not suppressed not sure why peterson doesn t know this maybe he isn t paying attention or why russell doesn t push back against peterson s false assertion maybe russell isn t paying attention to pop culture either and furthermore the evidence for this masculinization phenomenon and the socialcultural commentary related to it is all over youtube so there s not far to go to notice it it s right in front of your face,2,1
20,always had a good feeling about you man good to know i was right keep up the great work,5,2

26,jp 2 54 men and women are more the same than they are different rb 3 40 one of the challenges that this argument appears to be built around is a sort of hierarchy masculinity being synonymous with power rb 7 02 what is the terrible mother jp 7 04 overprotection jp 7 34 this is part of the devouring mother archetype jp 8 14 you see it in disney movies all the time in the little mermaid ursula is the devouring mother she s the witch she s the swamp dweller she s the evil queen rehashing the prevalence of mother bashing archetypes what about masculinity what about masculine archetypes the bully who threatens intimidates beats punches kicks and screams his way through life the controlling father who procreates in order to command his offspring to control their life paths who uses fear mongering tactics to weaken them enough to do so the family business dictator who expects his children to take over the reigns to help support his retirement near him the father step father uncle grandfather priest minister boss who think vaginas and other orifices were put on planet earth for the taking so they do take even when the answer is no the male kidnapper who locks up children in the basement for years without responsible equanimity of discussion you re just another male tag team building another word wall to bolster the masculine status quo same as it ever was,2,1

49,i think we as humans need to have some sort of toughness in us regardless if you are male or a female or transgender or whatever gender you are we need to take pride in what we do and always want to improve and build discipline,4,1
50,1950 s america is what it should be that s my opinion women are masculine now and men feminine look at the low cut shorts and skinny jeans that are trendy for men absolutely feminine look at women acting like hyenas and pit bulls,1,1
51,men are under attack take a ship for example that is crashed on a deserted island all traditional gender roles will naturally appear again,4,0
52,youtube has a very close to 50 50 gender split which is easy to simply google,1,0
53,this video is not loading are there some blue haired staffers at youtube messing with content they do not approve of,1,0
54,two smart respectful men,3,0
55,bruh your message is reaching the masses masculinity is now a currency you can see it every day,1,2
56,russell i love you like a older brother although the man bun looks stupid,4,2
57,so he can talk about the devouring mother and the good feminine archetype but he pushes back on people talking about toxic masculinity,3,1
58,these men don t seem masculine to me and that s great it s just the same reason we don t trust a thin chef we don t trust skinny weak effeminate emotional whiners like peterson and brand these are people easily outmanned by anything their own perception of masculinity is off to begin with believe it if you must but strong people don t need it to handle you,5,1
59,it sounds like they struck a nerve everything ok bro,3,0
60,it s sad that peterson cannot simply answer any questions otherwise people could easily twist his words on himself we are moving away from true conversations by complicating it and coming up with more words we cannot have a simple language cause there is to much truth in it and everyone is lying so here comes more complex words,2,1
61,it could be that young men are coming to youtube precisely to find people like jordan peterson,3,1
62,or any other source of good information since for many the father figure might be missing at home if masculinity and mastery are subjects of interest to you i invite you to explore the videos shared on the mastery order channel to challenge yourself with some ideas about manhood and to become the kind of man you would admire we can only better ourselves together as men among men so i invite you to use what i share and of course give your own opinions so that others can benefit from them as well looking forward to your points of view all the best to you,4,1
63,two of my favourite people,5,0
64,female to male ratio on youtube is 54 to 46,1,0
65,kathryn nails it in a one line comment below j peterson is a bit of a sullen guide to the weak men kathryn mentions,3,0
66,you look like a woman with a beard and you act gay so,1,2
67,there is a spectrum of masculine feminine traits in both sexes it is enforcing certain characteristics on each that creates inner conflict maternal overprotection is no worse than disinterest or abuse peterson should know that gender change is a result of the need to conform to stereotypes over 90 of male gender reassignments the most common are performed on those who worked in highly masculine jobs as a disguise if the world stopped trying to homogenise gender expectation it would probably cease to be an issue when female movie stars began wearing trousers there was little reaction it is now unquestioned if a man wears a dress it is an abnormal expression of masculinity this shows a huge disparity of gender freedom both masculine feminine traits which have an overlap can be toxic that is the desire to assert yourself over another all of these issues are all bound up in the dogma of religion you should be what we tell you to be has spread into various forms of indoctrination religion remains an integral part of our society it has served humanity badly on every level,2,1
68,i m saying this everywhere but just wanted to let you know jordan petersons name is inside a sexual trafficking book i m not sure if it s this peterson but it talks about a peterson in his younger years it s written by a canadian woman so unless there s other jordan petersons then it might not be him but there s a chance it might be him page 60 titled victim a feminist manifesto of a fierce survivor good luck if it s peterson everyone s talking about in this world y all are glorifying a contributor to sexual trafficking,1,1
69,jordan peterson is a very common name so idk,3,0
70,this was great and all gents but did you have to stop talking really interesting stuff thanks for bringing a sane little corner of the internet into being,4,1
71,almost everybody who watches youtube is male stop talking shit,1,0
72,a large majority is,3,0
73,rising respect for rb in recent months both as an interviewer and his obvious interest in parsing through our complicated civ here though he s overthinking it while i agree with peterson s comment that rb s hypothesis warrants thought there s a simpler explanation for boomers especially and carried over into xrs the prevailing assumption by the ad market decision makers has been that regardless that a household only have one income and it was brought in by the man the woman still made most of the day to day purchasing decisions was assumed to use most of the products more often after spending a couple of decades with that template and as commercials became more sophisticated were got more humor men have typically been the comic foils in mass media though there are notable exceptions however even in the 90 s maybe due to something like simpsonifocation or albundying lol we started seeing a lot of the boyfriend husband father as the oaf idiot simpleton like alllll the time,3,1
74,trickery 1970 hooray women you are now free to earn money and be independent 2010 women sorry it now needs two full time wages to feed ti family and pay your accommodation 2022 families the children are no longer yours but the property of the state to indoctrinate attack on masculinity women the family gender your freedom,1,1
75,what a joke j peterson talking about masculinity,1,0
76,man bun and talking about masculinity hello,1,0
77,its funny how people today confuse masculinity with how much testosterone you have in olden days a real man was a man who treated people and females with respect and dignity and acts of kindness and goodness how about the feminine in men men are born from a female body which means all men are half female too,4,1
78,i think your hair russell didn t help masculinity,2,0
79,omg what russell said about femininity being fullfilled through materialism because it s negated socially us so true emotionally neglected children and children with emotional trauma tend to have more money issues than children who weren t and that s straight from experience books and seeing a therapist lol it s crazy but true,1,1
80,i tapped out at 5 23 i m an economist and couldn t take the philosophical nature of this conversation any longer,1,0
81,watch a documentary called the red pill enjoy,5,0
82,4 06 brussel point of advertising sexualizing females to the use for consumers is so true look at the female celebrities like britney spears madonna doja cat dua lipa nicki minaj and many more in the past including transgender celebrities this list is not in order by the way the music industry abused this type of advertisement to maintain their power sadly they were mainly males that makes a lot of good males look bad,1,1
83,two good men,3,0
84,masculinity is as individual as the male born to it and is limited only by male imagination for example a male acting feminine is a form of masculinity just as a female acting masculine a form of feminism the intellectual debate is purely around defining acceptable male social behavior not what true masculinity is because we don t accept all male behavior as masculine which is a false definition,1,1
85,the holy spirit is the feminine it is very feminine it is powerful yet motherly toward humanity jordan needs to know that,5,1
86,i respect the shit out of russell brand for having these conversations cause they need to happen props to him for being attentive and wanting to have a genuine understanding of it love it russell keep it going,5,1
87,lol this is brilliant two eunuchs talking about masculinity russel brand i wish i was bi sexual and a life long drug addict and jordan peterson who sobs like a little girl at the slightest discomfort come on you can do better than this,5,0
88,it is so nice seeing two people who genuinely respect each other and are not out for eachothers throats,5,1
89,russel is so chill and eager to have his ideas questioned so funny when he s like what do you think i made it up really we all can learn so much from this conversation on how to grow and let our ideas be questioned,5,1
90,for some 20 years i was a single mother and breadwinner and found myself having to do battle with many people and circumstances in order to be both mother and provide for my 2 daughters my friends at the time being quite esoteric folks told me i was too masculine that i needed to work on being more feminine my point of view was that when you need to do battle probably a war negotiation or a battle axe is going to serve me better than whatever more feminine means now that my daughters are adults independent and professionals in their own careers my friends comment on not knowing how i did it balancing career motherhood children with learning disorders multiple therapists teachers who did not understand and an acrimonious ex husband various legal battles he threw at me financing all the extra therapies plus everything 2 young people in today s world need for all of 2 decades the answer is i had to go viking on it all my daughters were unhappy when i was clearly not as available as they would have liked growing up but i made sure we had plenty of family times and time out together in nature in the little leisure time we had now they understand the example and picture i gave them they are fully able to embrace both masculine feminine sides to their humanness the workplace and potential partners are not particularly ready for that though they are just not your average women they have fully embraced their masculine side with being definitely women who mean business in today s world at home metaphorically speaking they are definitely not used to giving up the remote we never had that issue in a 3 woman household embracing both sides is just not comfortable for women there is still enormous stereotyping working against women being allowed to be that women are frequently punished severely at home in social groups and even quite definitively in the workplace where equality of competence should be most of tolerated,2,1
91,don t worry cucker is getting yall free viagra for your prob,5,0
92,russell lacks testosterone you can tell,2,2
93,i have heard preachers preach since i was a kid and screw kids in the bathroom seen politicians call each other names in public and clap each other on the back in a private gentleman club laughing at the stupid public i don t believe anything any more not you not anyone it s all garbage the only reason i don t jump off a bridge is like patty page said i am not ready for that final disappointment men don t protect women they feed off of them,1,1
94,it s very cute how russell brand clearly admires and respects jordan peterson s knowledge,5,0
95,russel is one of a few that can speak about drug abuse politics hollywood and just about anything because he jas been through the bottom and the top,1,1
96,you have to have a place at the table for the serpent i think that ties nicely into the idea of embracing your shadow and becoming a monster as jordan peterson talks about a lot good stuff,4,1
97,sorry i had to comment because the youtube gods decided to drop a video in my algorithms about masculinity from a dude with a man bun that s all,1,1
98,youtubes audience isn t 80 male but 56,1,0
99,i love me a strong manly man glad i married before these newer cheaper made models,5,0
100,brand is clever especially given his lack of education but the limits of his intellect are clearly evident in the company of a mind like peterson s just an observation not a condemnation i d likely seem no better,3,1
101,it s bloody lovely,5,0
102,russel brand i would love to chat with you wow the things you say are so on point deep beyond boundaries you say the things im thinking and you are not afraid of it you put words on thoughts and experiences i have about society and life and just deliver it in a nice package its just like magic you are so intellectual and everytime i listen to you i feel validated awesome,5,2
103,it was a bit car crash tv but there was a programme a while back called young dumb and living with mum which stuck a group of 18 yr olds in a house together and monitored them most all were coming from homes where their parents were in despair over their childs laziness or inability to cope with the most basic tasks it was truly shocking to see 18yr olds asking for advice on how to heat up a tin of beans or turn on a washing machine it suggested the kind of parenting jordan speaks of here i don t want to point fingers people can slip into habits or make a simple mistake that just snowballs but really if a child from a supposedly stable home is reaching 18 with no idea how to make a meal for itself or wash its own clothes the parents have to take a look at themselves you are not helping your children by smothering them with care and leaving them unable to take care of themselves even if you re rich and think you ll always be able to pay someone to do things for you you should still know how to take care of essential needs never say never,2,1
104,woman here you both open my eyes and mind to new angles on old issues,5,2
105,what if the wounded masculine is healed with kindness and understanding not judgement,1,0
106,jordan spouts a lot of shite that he does not back up quick google search shows youtube user base shows users as 55 percent male and 45 percent female not the 80 20 his viewership reflects and which he claims mirrors the youtube user base this is not correct he is not correct about a lot of things it s fine to make assertions and conclusions but hedge a little bit man throw in a caveat or two you just look dumb spouting cock sure inaccuracies,1,1
107,toonski plays i very much doubt i will find a difference did you even bother to look,2,2
108,this interview is from 3 years ago your stats are from 2021,5,0
109,i love jordan learning to love you too russel,5,2
110,we really need masculinity in this crazy feminist era we re living in men need help and guidance not being put down by evil feminists you go guys,5,2
111,i wish you could get joaquin phoenix on the podcast,4,2
112,fk this is good shit gents,4,0
113,i think that s a great point russel about society sexualizing femininity and idolizing that it makes me think that as women funnel there feminine behavior and nature in that way as a consequence they don t funnel or nurture it in there relationships or to there partner properly there taught to express there feminine nature sexually to society and also through social media there relationships then lack the feminine nurturing it needs,2,1
114,so feminine energy is equated with the demonic,2,0
115,jordan talks like a whiny little boy it s quite distracting,3,0
116,i know more women then men are watching youtube,2,0
117,good conversation,4,0
118,i remember years ago i thought russel brand is a bumbling idiot now i have nothing but respect for the guy,1,0
119,masculinity can t be toxic there is just masculinity and different levels of it,1,1
120,i don t think it has as much to do with masculinity than it does with personality and the shadow i think that men and women that don t see their own shadow are far more likely to be toxic in general letting go of pride is the first step in reducing your biological and psychological impulses and judgements,3,1
121,why does jordan peterson always get badly lit,1,0
122,i feel like russell s real life goal is to use every single word in the dictionary waiting till he gets to zebra,4,0
123,that would be eminem lol,3,0
124,i love these archetypal stories with jordan peterson they re his most fascinating tales it s just like greek mythology for the 21st century,5,0
125,i d love to see a lauren southern russell conversation,5,0
126,glad i found this good talk,5,0
127,russell sounds like the one guy in drama class who actually cared about the lesson but had absolutely no acting skills whatsoever,1,0
128,it s so cute how starsruck russell is here 3,5,0
129,very refreshing conversation,5,0
130,when i had my babies i was raising children now that they re children i m raising adults if i spend 18yrs raising children then i m not doing what s best for them if it weren t for jordan peterson s wisdoms around single mothers and the balance between masculinity and femininity in myself and the development of my son s and daughters i d have suffocated the relationship with my eldest son in particular years ago,2,1
131,i just want to say i love this comment section as much as i love the video it s actually hard to find an argument or a hateful comment this is what the whole internet should be like,5,1
132,2 of my favorite people,5,0
133,umm the evil queen stepmother architype is evil because overprotective did we read the same fairytales growing up i distinctly recall a poisoned apple also the 4th element is either the female or the devil yup that sounds like our mythology one of the first things i learned growing up was that female bad and male good you run like a girl you throw like a girl you hit like a girl girls don t understand math 3d spatial reasoning insert smart topic here i don t think the phrase toxic masculinity means that masculinity is toxic and i think it is disingenuous to imply that this is what is meant being an a hole is toxic but that a holery is acceptable even lauded if you are a masculine man,1,1
134,they promote masculinity in women and feminity in men the result is both sides are miserable,1,1
135,no matter how physically strong and masculine you are the masculinity is toxic when you are emotionally weak that s a more feminine quality and if you haven t accepted that and aren t in balance that is when you begin to mask your insecurities with strength and needing to dominate the same thing can happen in women then when they ve had trauma from men and feel like they aren t protected by men and can t be comfortable in their femininity around them that s when they feel like they need to to everything a man can do but it s exhausting,2,1
136,the way you ve put all that i ve never thought of before but yeah totally agree with you with regards toxic masculinity when a man is emotionally weak and uses his physical strength presence to dominate people it always causes harm such as men who recently have been in the news who have been spiking women at nightclubs with needles as a male i believe it is our responsibility to guide other men away from seriously harmful behaviours which ruin society just as women to guide other women with respect to certain issues,5,1
137,i m sorry but did jordan peterson compare women to the devil and use harry potter and disney s sleeping beauty as justification huh,2,0
138,russell brand this is a joke right,1,0
139,56 of people that watch youtube are male it s not the biggest of disparities here maybe men gravitate to you more jordan because you are frequently talking about men and masculinity or maybe also that conservatives are men leaning uh duh,2,1
140,a doctor talking about being a man,5,0
141,thats an original idea of jung cool,3,0
142,i knew that russell brand was or is an actor but didn t watch his movies what i love about him is his great mind great thoughts and just personality thank you russell for that channel,5,2
143,why platform this guy russell,1,0
144,my masculinity has me outside splitting firewood right alone with my husband because he should not have to do it by himself at the same time when our boys were little he was far better than me at getting them down for a nap the key word is balance women who are excessively girly are toxic too and they make me sick just like a toxic male would,2,1
145,he says 80 of youtube users are men but i find numbers like 45 online,1,0
146,one of my favorite actors in the same room with one of my favorite political artists psychology professors amazing i love it keep on keeping on you two,5,2
147,i love both of these guys they re both so open to constructive discourse love to see it,5,1
148,as a women who engages in the youtube platform daily i talk to more men who know of jordan peterson that s not to say the women i show peterson to don t enjoy his lectures they all love him they just haven t been exposed to him,3,1
149,seriously two of my favourite minds here when i first started watching russell brand and then jordan peterson on youtube individually i remember thinking how much i d love to see them together low and behold i found this video yay i could sit and listen to them all day russell brand and jordan peterson thank you for speaking up and sharing your thoughts with the world your intelligence and common sense is so refreshing right now,5,1
150,two absolute powerhouse intellectuals in the same room i love it,5,0
151,masculinity does not negate femininity it is catalysed by femininity the submissiveness of feminity is active and primary with regard to agency however femininity uncoupled from maternalism becomes an exercise in pointlessness exploited by the social engineers to destroy masculinity the strategy of saturating the public arena with sensationalised female sexuality while simultaneously pathologizing the natural masculine response to it is derived from pavlovs experiments in which he manufactured neurosis in dogs by simultaneously issuing excitory and inhibitory commands throwing a stick and at the same time saying stay the possible relevance of these experiments to sudden religious and political conversion should be obvious even to the most sceptical pavlov has shown by repeated and repeatable experiment just how a dog like a man can be conditioned to hate what it previously loved and love what it previously hated similarly one set of behaviour patterns in man can be temporarily replaced by another that altogether contradicts it not by persuasive indoctrination alone but also by imposing intolerable strains on a normally functioning brain william sargant battle for the mind,1,1
152,wow amazing epic,5,0
153,0 55 i agree with jordan i have a female friend who watches youtube stumbled across jp and follows him because she liked the ideas,1,0
154,my two favorite experts on a multitude of topics yay and thanks,5,0
155,i haven t seen russell this nervously excited before he almost seems less confident than normal he is absolutely working for jp s approval and it s kind of cute in bittersweet way probably an aspect of his lack of masculine role models and peers and spaces growing up like he said on the jre that and his obvious respect for peterson so happy these conversations are starting to give masculinity healthy expression in popular culture,4,1
156,it never gets old seeing the spark in someones eyes when jp is talking that s when the conversation changes and really begins,3,1
157,this is how debates should be,5,0
158,two brilliant minds i could listen to this for hours,5,0
159,the feminine is not being properly honered socially he understood the assignment,2,0
160,brilliant to get you two together,5,2
161,we can be masculine without being toxic,5,0
162,but the femininity in men is somehow offputing or irrelevant to jordan interesting he only thinks women need to be more masculine,3,1
163,if jp were alt right he wouldn t even be having this conversation his stances on women are actually very modernistic and liberal ie this case with motherhood having a good moral code in guiding your children letting them make mistakes and letting them learn being a powerful mother father confident and a good role model for your offspring good stuff,4,1
164,the essence of the problem as i see it is that the masculine aggression drive risk taking and creativity is being supressed as dangerous and offensive so men are forced to not behave like they actually need to behave to be able to execute their lifes like they need to do to be able to drive society forward this has again led to a stagnation and the women that has triggered this is not happy either it s a western first world problem,2,1
165,sex dont sell lol,1,0
166,two amazing minds so quick and agile i could listen to these guys all night,5,0
167,two humans conversing and working with their brains how about that,2,0
168,see this is a conversation of learning not just try cancelling ppl because you don t understand,5,2
169,someone explain this conversation to me like im two years old thanks a bunch,5,0
170,i love russell brands serious conversations i like that he is able to sit with someone who has different views disagree at times gracefully and at the same time having respect for that person i like learning from him,4,1
171,peterson i would have to think about that a long time before answering it its an idea worth thinking about for a while peterson that intellectual beast is humble enough to admit that he has no opinion on the subject and is not willing to answer impulsively at the other hand russell has such a beautiful mind that could bring a man like peterson to this point beautiful high quality stuff glad that i have found those two,4,1
172,well also we as consumers don t see the public scrutiny that he gets daily over every little thing said even out of context i think if i were in jordan s position i d be stuck to even get a sentence out without wanting to correct myself and put asterisks everywhere lol,1,1
173,i know right so cool to see him once again affirm his desire to always be precise in his speech and commentary i think that s much harder to do than making a snap comment for the sake of doing so too many people think they need to answer right away,5,1
174,yes masculinity needs to be developed in women just as much as femininity needs to be developed in men each without abandoning their own foundational natural way of being,3,1
175,the parts where they discussed the devouring mother and toxic parenting hits home so hard i think there are way too many people in their teens and early twenties that feel like they have to seek validation from their parents just to feel good about themselves when the parents in the family are put up on a pedestal it can create a huge amount of stress and tension in families i think it s very important to have healthy honest boundaries in families,4,1

200,it seems strange and hilarious how these guys can view their own mothers as mere specimens feminity i think they re just hiding from the real issue which is about people just doing the right thing,3,1
201,calling out all natural harmonious thrivers of nature shout outs to us this phrase tough times create strong men good times create weak men has a lot of misconstrued misused over analytical externally attached rubbish in some areas stemming from a monetary system vs living in the natural real world these tough modern men would not survive in the wild without some gun because they think that thriving is about surviving almost as if they have forgotten or are unaware of gardening and self sustainability that s not really tough stuff and it takes more than sheer force to go from surviving to thriving i swear people just pick something that sounds catchy but don t really reflect deep enough on these things aristotle once said whosoever is delighted in solitude is either a wild beast or a god many of us do delight in solitude in any kinds of changing times guess that makes us beast gods goddesses so i guess this also means that peoples linear concepts of hard times and good times is a limiting belief aka a brule score 9000 to the people surpassing these human made brules meant to divide humanity our love is stronger than the perceived divisive biases created by what is clearly emotionally hurt men who dont seem to realize that their problems isn t another human but a currently evolving economic system that geniusly has enslaved the people thankfully even that is changing and the people and even animals are uniting against these unholy men and women or beings hell bent on delusions of control power imagined self importance greed temporary constructs that are inevitably impermanent namaste,1,1

205,how about we start framing the positive aspects of masculinity instead of having a hard focus on the toxic elements,4,1
206,it s almost weird to see two people who actually listen have a discussion today listening is a skill most people only hear and believe they are listening while they wait impatiently for their opportunity to shoehorn in a trite talking point they picked up in whatever echo chamber they usually haunt it s refreshing in one sense to watch this video but ultimately somewhat worrisome in that there does not appear to be a path before us to a time again where this would be the norm,3,1
207,wonderful conversation russell you are so honest and curious it s so nice to see two people having an exchange of thoughts and ideas this is something so many people have lost the ability to do i can see and hear the genuine excitement in yours eyes and voice love you bro,5,1

226,there is so much variance in masculine feminine qualities in either men and women that it is fair to say we are equal furthermore these roles may completely change in different cultures suggesting it is socially constructed there is no need conform to some prescribed identity role except to fulfill some societal traditions or customs identity can be as unique as you want though fluid in its adaptation to society,3,1

234,young men need role models and unfortunately there aren t as many in local communities and in the media the message of what a man should be and how he should act is completely shattered luckily there are y few channels that share useful messages like jocko podcast mastery order order of man jordan b peterson if you are a young man searching for answers and looking for a role model share and learn these messages and if you were lucky enough to have a great role model in your life share your knowledge so that others can benefit as well become a great man that can be trusted and relied upon cheers reader,2,1

236,over protection of males happens in asian culture for sure,2,0
237,i understand they are both talking about masculinity but i think peterson brought something very important to the table of parents letting children fail in order for them to create a mental pattern for them to solve their mistake or try to find a reasonable enough conclusion on how to avoid that failure in other words learning,4,1
238,petersen thinks assertiveness power equates to masculinity why can t femininity be assertive why does a woman have to borrow from masculinity answer bc jp can t think beyond gender traditions,1,0
239,exactly it reminds me of when peterson was talking about why women wear lipstick the only reason he could come up with was sex based he lacked the intelligence to grasp there s also a wealth status symbol factor a communal factor and most obviously an individuals self expression he s just so cringe worthy,5,1
240,6 19 cool russel brand,5,0
241,men need masculine energy from society but here s my theory feminism is inescapable it s crossed all types of establishment from university and work etc i used to think feminism was important to help allow men to better understand the emotions of their significant other or someone they re dating and to some extend i believe that is necessary so that men can understand if a good woman is not ready for sex on the first date and the man continues to push getting sex out of her till she sub misses the idea let s not kid ourselves it s rape however my stink for feminism indirectly allowed women to believe that being a woman gives them all the privileges and none of the responsibilities of being an adult,1,1

245,it seems like the focus gets lost in the aesthetic more than the motivation behind the action example frontiersman and tribesmen back in the day had to frickin build their own homes survive brutal attacks from hostile neighbors and work eighteen hours a day just because a modern man doesn t bench 300 pounds shoot a gun with deadly accuracy and whatever else doesn t mean he s not doing the same things protecting his family building a home and earning a living,2,1

251,i think russell brand is a good guy but hes not all there i think drugs did their damage,2,0
252,the same can be said for peterson considering he was ruthlessly addicted to pills for years his addiction was so bad he had to be placed in a medically induced coma mr clean up your room and do the responsible thing was a a low down junkie,1,1
253,i love to sit on your show or even do a pod cast to shed a lot of light on rather one to share common knowledge and me my self i have an way way over protective mother my ex who i am not allowed to see i dred the thing s she is putting into his head and raising our child alone,5,1
254,thank u russle thank u not being properly honerd well sed,1,0
255,how amazing is jordan peterson when he s not being attacked by rabid people with victim complexes,5,0
256,to russell in regards to the feminine being most commonly used to sell a product or an idea is for me is that the masculine is widely being presented as toxic and maleness is an oppressive bad thing so we now see masculine products being sold by females who are perceived as good and giving the feminine ok to this product just look at the gillette razor adverts that blatantly denounce masculinity while trying to sell products to men women are now the only ones that can be trusted to promote male products as a male selling the same product or idea would be attacked as being toxic or untrustworthy this is also why it s women are trusted to defend men s rights and speak up on behalf of men as men defending themselves is also attacked by the anti male community as toxic this also i think accounts for so many young impressionable boys that don t want to be men when they grow up due to the social vilification of men and maleness by the overwhelmingly female education systems,1,1
257,is russel smart or does he just have a british accent we may never know,3,0
258,really happy to see russel have jordan on i absolutely hate how much crap people give jordan peterson in the media and on sites like reddit he s obviously not some bad guy who s trying to steal your sons and convert them to the far right jordan is hardly even right wing i don t even understand why he s labelled as the far right,5,1

262,i taught my son how to cook clean and balance his checkbook before he left home teach your child independence personal strength and not to listen to other people s opinions of who you are and what you should be be true to yourself first,5,1

268,masculinity is being driven from all aspects of society and will continue to be so until the day it s needed,5,1
269,the thing i like most about russel is his openess he plays with and explores with ideas he doesn t seek moral superiority and he s not judgmental at all i don t agree with him in a lot bit he s an honest person searching for the truth,3,1

298,until people understand that language dictates thought these misinterpretations will continue to plague mankind,1,0
299,firstly eat more food and you will become a bigger and a more mascular man in addition men only have concerns about masculinity because they are too light and they have been educated to eat less food and remain light and lean furthermore their is a massive difference between a heavy man that eats a huge amount of food and a lean man that small amount of food this will create some masculinity concerns for the lean men and they can get frustrated with their lower masculinity therefore if you feel that your masculinity is falling to low it will make you feel better to eat two dinners every day for half a year,3,1
300,i made it up,5,0
301,that statement about the pervasive advertising yes all we have is shopping having sex has even been taken from us,1,0
302,belly bounce,3,0
303,we are the result of our own life experiences it s done when the mobile phone replaces parents then things go wrong it was not so long ago that an engineer told me he did not like emancipated women is it related to the man s masculinity i myself thrive best in the company of men than to talk about for example women s things such as reading gossip newspapers cleaning washing dishes etc and even if i am purity myself and live a healthy life very boring topics that do not inspire my brain at all it s just as boring to talk about money too zzz how does the following proverb relate to masculinity or is it about contempt for women where it considers the woman to be less worthy than the man emancipated women do not need to emancipate themselves they are not as good as men the whole emancipation rumor has not changed that women make themselves beautiful to please men the preference of men for full beard is linked to the emancipation of women because even the most emancipated woman does not come with the full beard and finally why do men around the world abuse and murder women what is the purpose of it do not misinterpret me i like men but not those who treat women badly they have no place in my life at all i could never be with a man who abuses women to feel masculine,2,1

313,i respect the hell outta russell brand cause he has civil discussions with people i usually disagree with him but that s what i respect there s nothing wrong with disagreements that s normal also so glad to see jordan peterson back at it and doing well,4,1
314,here s the thing when you build the masculine in women it will repeal masculine men in romantic relationships it s the balance of the feminine woman and masculine man polarity that works so well together in the long run,5,1
315,6 18 cool,5,0
316,if people keep feeding the world with ignorance and selfishness there will be no meaningful future inequalities discrimination violence and war this is what happens when we don t care about each other so don t be fools and wake up and pay attention start now actually use your voice and talk about meaningful conversation civilization depends on us getting back to listening to learn and talking to be heard away with the selfish life of social media and the news peer away and it s not as hard as you think,1,1
317,the expression of females in consumerism as an extension or act of worship is hogwash the commercialization of women is more often than not limited to child looking women who have no resonance of a woman or her body the societal expectations for young girls are reflected on this false narrative and impact the psyche of the young woman the disconnected imagery starts an act of self hatred in young women the most common imagery is exploited women who malnourish their bodies and subject themselves to sexual abuse from wealthy men instead of commercializing smart women who are attractive regardless of size the focus is on a few wealthy men s image of beauty which is teenager they can control or tell what to do epstein really had his hands in a lot of things and or did well for a reason,1,1
318,if modern liberals were like russell there would not be an exodus,2,0
319,but here s the big secret every realm had the same form of health and sickness as every other realm that s why no realm can dominate or control another every top has the same type of dignity and identical privilege with different reflections that reflect the distinct realms that s how god and me are equal we each represent a type of zenith in distinct realms and each realm holds a key that prevents any one from dominating another and when each key is achieved each realm knows why dominance isn t to be desired when one learns from other cultures it might not change anything immediately but it does remove resentment and create solutions and acceptance and courage and eliminated needy cravings that caused oppression sharing wisdom makes the world better inevitably,5,1
320,learning at the majority of youtube viewers are male makes a lot more sense based on how the majority of the media i consume on this platform tends to not even recognize that women are just people have we come to consider that maybe the whole thing is a spectrum and that masculine versus feminine is just another part of the patriarchy like russell says that masculinity is synonymous with power and how about that that sex work is illegal and yet a woman can be hired to represent a company in a certain way to convey the emotion that the soulless economy wishes it could represent please wake up and realize we re all just humans in meat sacks who don t have the right to judge any body thank you russell when the time comes i would love to have you help found a religion that is not a religion just considered a religion for the sake of economic and lawful reasons in this broken country that doesn t value individuals and bodily autonomy without something written in the law to say that some god will smite them if they don t allow the religious to not get a vaccine or it s only work a certain amount of hours per week the system itself needs to stop being upheld so thank you very much russell i as a woman who would be unable to thrive on this planet without my own firm belief of value and autonomy because everything else in this society is so vehemently against that in order to sell me something to make me think i am finally worthy hear you and appreciate you,2,1
321,how did this guy become so based not doing narcotics 24 hrs a day probably helps much respect to rb i m sure he gets flack from the rainbow mob all the time for his normal views on humanity,4,0
322,i just saw a clip of mr peterson and his husband mr peterson should stop talking about masculinity because if he s married to that it means he has no clue what it is holy hell,1,1
323,or maybe the commodification in consumerism makes the light available to allow men to embody the feminine independently of having access to a spouse women taught me that it s more important to build my own world through consumerism than to be attached to the feminine by need of the feminine consumerism actually would make it possible to mitigate and make prostitution less a thing if a man can own his own spiritual sexuality then women wouldn t have that debt to men which actually liberates women basically men can t respect women unless they don t need women and the sad thing is women had been conditioned to believe that being needed and being respected are the same thing and they re not which is why women have had a tendency to oppress themselves to show how needed they are and that s how women held themselves back because of confusing need with respect respect is more secure than need but women have seemed to have been taught that if she is needed then she is secure and that s a logical fallacy because need created neediness in men that created spiritual poverty in men that created an abusive relationship of some males relationship to women that women themselves had created in part i say in part not to blame because women had been victimized to some degree but identifying as a victim means that a woman s pride as victim is what keeps a woman a spiritual prisoner and the good news of that is that a woman can just walk out of that prison at will in my private life i ve sometimes been hard on the female perspective in relating the traps of some women to men but my point with that is it doesn t matter what who did to who be strong and protect yourself and it s better for all involved to dismiss victim narratives because those narratives often had the argument that because this or that group had been hurt that you should just let yourself be hurt and that s just fucking stupid that s not natural there s something animalistic and righteous in dismissing the past and respecting ones own humanity then human decency has a blank slate and that s something only individuals can give themselves the logical fallacy of the koran though as interpreted by some is that it s logically impossible to make the world into a world wide caliphate because that assumed that gods work with everyone else was a mistake that needed to be erased and that s arrogant that directly contradicts the best value of middle eastern culture which is humility humility implies a willingness to learn listen and grow with other human beings not control or dominate other human beings white people have had a past the best wisdom of white culture is that light shines naturally when home is honored and not earned cherished white history and past racism had contradicted that value but that doesn t mean that value isn t there because it is simplifying value of the family makes great cultural achievements versailles and several other shameless over expensive buildings weren t built for the sake of oppression the spiritual debt there was there and couldn t not be there part of the tragedy of human history but using that temporary moment of injustice to make something beautiful is one step of grace to eliminate injustice black culture is one of strength and resilience shaka zulu created a mythology of warriors who could walk anywhere because their feet had no shoes but that same formlessness led to an arrogance that seemed to confuse strength with valuing nothing one strong black man once said love was a weakness and that s wrong but i also listened to his insights love needs to incorporate business sense or love is weak that was me being willing to listen and respect black insight to strengthen my relationship with my own cultural insight about home and the clarity that inevitability brings and the sense of humility and willingness to fearlessly learn from someone else that would possibly be the best form of middle eastern culture courage is something all cultures share to prevent catastrophe i m the anomaly in white culture my wisdom has had a natural prince of darkness quality and as a cultural exchange in the nineteenth century i traveled to africa and functioned as a priest with shaka zulu for future mutual benefit we created a common mind of mutual wisdom thats what happened,2,1
324,the enemies of the masculine in men are also the enemies of the masculine in women i actually disagree with jordan here i believe the enemies of the masculine in men do so to promote and prop up the masculinity in women i think its the femininity in women that s being persecuted not the masculinity,3,1
325,it s insane how people think dr peterson is the equivalent of a nazi,1,0
326,he s just a quack,1,0

333,i don t always agree with russell but i respect him but man burns aren t masculine at all,3,0

353,you two supremely alpha males should have whipped your willies out and see who has the biggest,5,2
354,i have to disagree with jordan here on the truism why else did the terms masculinity and femininity form if they were not cultural truisms throughout the ages the difference is significant enough to yield mass acceptance through all cycles of society through peace and war perhaps i m guilty of not seeing the additions context within his discussion,4,1
355,russell is one of a very small number of liberals having an honest conversation with all types of people good for him wish there were more like him good intentions and a sincere effort to navigate the shit show were all dealing with,2,1
356,jordan peterson is a hack and a snake oil salesman i don t understand why anyone gives him a platform,1,0
357,this is fucking hilarious,5,0
358,if you are having trouble with a positive image of your maleness have your estrogen levels checked before you dismiss this comment consider the following 1 there are so many foods that are loaded with estrogen such as soy products flax seed many things that fatten animals etc 2 men are getting more sensitive but not through empathy through too much accumulated estrogen 3 women are also estrogen dominant and it s playing havoc with their cycle plus they are stuck viewing life through their feelings it s more difficult to view things rationally when hormones are flooding their brain 4 this alone is weakening our natural mechanisms for learning evolutionary biologists are studying the phenomenon,1,1
359,80 of youtube audiences are male where is he pulling that statistic from his own youtube studio i don t think that s a fair comment youtube isn t male dominated as a whole xd men were just going to his channel more because it interested them more xd,1,1

366,i come to listen to peterson talk about politics and masculinity i leave wondering where i can get his book on parenting,2,0
367,why does he makes up statistics everywhere and generalizes stuff its 56 male on youtube so no it s not generally true in case of youtube,1,0
368,i ve grown so tired of the hard line i m right and you re wrong types that seem to inhabit every area of my life real world online etc i am so thankful for those who truly wish to have discussions in an attempt to understand views which oppose their own what a breath of fresh air this was,5,1
369,two awesome humans having a meaningful conversation lovely on the ears,5,0
370,russell brand continues to pleasantly surprise and impress me with his takes on different topics even though i think i basically know his stance on issues i m constantly amazed at how difficult it is to paint him as a partisan he masterfully keeps the daggers from being thrown about very respectful indeed much appreciated sir,5,0
371,my 2 favorite persons on yt,5,0
372,uni y is probably my name fav british word,3,0
373,it doesn t help that we have these psychotic karen types around spreading their misery usually they have started themselves so much to day thin they are brainwashed and psychotic or the botox gets into their brain these man hating botulism zombies are as shameless as they are malicious they have a narcissistic delusion that all men are stupid and they are cleverer and smarter than everyone and anyone who breaks this illusion gets their full wrath for showing they are actually quite thick and nasty without their fantasy world protection,1,1
374,this is that interview i ve been waiting for,5,0
375,depends what you define as masculine too for instance anger issues and wanting to pick fights with every guy over the smallest things is that masculine or is that being a meathead being overly sexual and pervy to the point of scaring a woman is that masculinity there are some very positive sides to masculinity that help push along society but part of that involves self control too this is where i think feminists and trads clash they cant agree on the definition,2,1
376,start with chopping off all manbuns,1,0
377,i use to be a bun man not anymore get rid of the buns,1,1

389,114 simon peter said to them make mary leave us for females don t deserve life jesus said look i will guide her to make her male so that she too may become a living spirit resembling you males for every female who makes herself male will enter the kingdom of heaven,1,1
390,nobody is denouncing masculinity it s hypermasculinity that s the problem i suppose there will always be those who can t tell the difference on both sides of this issue,1,1
391,it is absolutely insane that in order to explain why masculinity should be encouraged and developed in men peterson has to couch it in terms of what s good for women it s as if brand sees no value in men so he can t fathom why it s worth helping them of course coming from a feminine man like himself perhaps i shouldn t be surprised,1,1
392,main thing i get from your talks with jordan peterson is that you really enjoy discussions with jordan peterson and i feel from the videos that the feeling is mutual,4,1
393,and this ladies and gentlemen is what a healthy conversation looks like if most modern conversation looks like a bar fight this was competition level martial arts,5,0
394,the movie carrie,5,0
395,the devouring mother needs to learn to be like mother bird you feed them you raise them but always push them to spread their own wings,3,2
396,russell i can t tell you how much watching your videos assist me in managing my own thoughts you are bringing almost every imaginable topic to the table your last video with jordan really helped me in an area i was struggling with it was emotionally disturbing to me in a very positive manner how to be moral and also not cast it aside in my employment when jordan mentioned how much more reward do you need than knowing someone has benefited from something you shared that was the goal to help correct you try but you don t know and than you found it helped someone profoundly that would be surprising and very humbling very i don t go to church often and i have even found myself questioning religion however i can not imagine jesus as he has been described not being his most pleased by a person simply helping someone else and genuinely caring that is simple but it s most true thank you for caring and providing so much thought provoking commentary what a person you have become another trait that would be admired by a kind and loving higher being selfless i am attempting to improve thanks for the content to help in this i want you to know that i am truly grateful,5,2
397,both these guys as smart as i d like to be but what a journey to get there i m to lazy deep thought common sense and decency for all that want honest wise opinions love listening to both thanks guys,5,1
398,machismo is one of the manifestatios of meritocracy machismo is the easiest possibility for any boy and man to feel superior meritocracy leads everyone to try to feel superior,5,1
399,i like jordan peterson he makes so much sense and i just happen to like things that make sense the world should listen to this man,5,1
400,in one the shrek movies the fairy godmother is the devouring mother can t remember which one but it was fiona s mother and the dragon before that,4,1
401,love russell b but talking masculinity while wearing a man bun seems a bit ironic nothing masculine about the man bun,3,0
402,who was in charge of the white balance in the edit on this video hahaha,1,1
403,sound is fucked,1,0
404,and most women are attracted to man visually as a man is to a women,2,1
405,women raising boys is enough damage to ruin those boys for their life boys need a man in their life,1,0
406,russell you remind me of my dog i love to hate him good work,5,2
407,what to do with over protective parents it seems there s no escape from that you re weak enough and too vulnerable to fight that and they have a system of 100 or zero support to keep you in chain,3,1
408,i used to respect jordan immensely but he really sunk to a low level when he told people to just get the jab,2,1
409,4 34 russell super excited jordan is like let s calm down for a second,5,0
410,could not agree more important conversation here,1,0
411,jordan s followers are mostly men because they are looking for leadership and validity he has changed so many men s lives for the better he s a treasure,5,1
412,stop hiding the link to the joel greenberg child sex trafficking indictment i m sure your viewers want to learn about current elected republican officials who are charged with child sex trafficking so stop deleting my posting of the link that tells them how to see it are you afraid of informing your low intelligence viewers,1,1
413,is anyone else tired of elected officials getting charged with child sex trafficking,1,0
414,the weird lighting makes this feel like a rerun,4,0
415,you guys talk to much focusing on trivial topics is a waist men want to right what s wrong,1,2
416,utter click bait wank to sucker empty heads alexa define snake oil,1,0
417,a whole load of rubbish wrapped up in fancy words,1,0
418,look at jordan his past and his daughter then ask yourself if this is the guy you want to take advice from crackpot,4,2
419,it s obvious that just like a child everybody should engage in some kind of art form in order to self reflect and fathom out who they are once people connect with themselves and accept who or what they are they soon realise that there is no difference between males and females except from the gender physiology we are born and the super imposed indoctrination which we either choose to accept and work with or reject and reinvent ourselves as something else or something new original and authentic,5,1
420,russell has matured a lot in recent years he is willing to learn now instead of jumping in with preconceived ideas or saying what he thinks will be popular this makes the conversation much more interesting as it s less predictable,4,1
421,from the first second i saw jordan in this interview i knew it was old footage he seems less worried a bit more relaxed here i hope he can recover and get back to this stage again,3,0
422,proper pathways to masculinity this dude is the man,5,0
423,being emotionally intelligent is not synonymous with being weak,3,0
424,they re the darkness the absence of light controlling your thoughts bringing the night i don t know all your stories or all your reasons why but i know what makes humans afraid to die and again i sigh,5,1
425,jesus is god almighty jordan peterson is bible illiterate,1,0
426,with that reasoning your suggesting god won t use you if you don t spew out bible verse,1,2

428,i don t often agree with russell but i do appreciate his willingness to listen and discuss different points of view,3,0
429,thank the maker i m a generationxer google it if you must,5,2
430,i thought for a moment jordan said he was a psychomatrician that would have seriously changed the conversation,2,0
431,crystalline distilled truth,5,0
432,i wanted to hear the entire conversation,3,0
433,not very masculine to have a hair transplant peterson lol,2,0
434,the diamond is strong because of the bonds between its atoms jp wants us atomized to be the ultimate individual and the we are nothing but wind,5,1
435,i m not sure where jordan is getting the statistic that on average on youtube there is 80 20 male female ratio when in its more like 54 46 male female globally and in the us it s pretty close to 50 50,3,1
436,there s no point in this discussion without first specifically defining masculinity as it relates to the conversation had,1,0
437,love this conversation,5,0
438,as a woman i have no appreciation for using woman s sex and sexuality to sell products and services i find it demeaning does not honor women and would like to see this go away,2,1
439,i don t know why people are so obsessed about gender lately it gets so much hype when the emphasis should really be on character traits like morals and maturity and intelligence work ethic etc imo if a person has lots of good traits they will be a good person regardless of gender age race etc,2,1
440,interviewing that bloody psycho is not brave or being open minded all it does is convince those strange peterson fan boys of all ages whose balls haven t dropped yet that the creature is a serious intellectual with something relevant to say instead of the psychopathic personality he actually is whose only priority is jordan peterson,1,1
441,jordan peterson s an intelligent and insightful guy brand though an airhead if ever there was one,4,0
442,in christianity the church is the bride,5,0

447,whats the symbol on your jacket,5,0
448,women don t need a template women express themselves by they re own action and being,5,1
449,flase all things need a template that s why many people are the same our similarities are what being us together and that is an evolutionary biological fact what you say might sound lime some good ole empowerment but its false amd completely against who we are as human beings the very reason we have the longest periods of childhood amongst animals where we have to be raised by our parents is precisely because we need a template to live our lives most people are made up of what they have been raised on even if they go on to join and identify with other tribes but make no mistake it is not the norm for humans to walk alone and hold beliefs and ideologies separate from any group ever existing,1,1
450,im surprised jordan did not bust out crying like he usually does at random,5,0
451,russel seems offended or holding anger that s the problem with our liberal friends they can t comprehend that someone has a different opinion from them because they look at themselves as morally superior,2,1
452,read cruel hoax by henry makow phd,1,0
453,anyone else see the video loading but not playing,1,0
454,that emblem on rb hoodie looks similar to the lincoln park emblem interesting,4,0

456,i find it hilarious that in every video with jp in it the comment section is full of people using big words that they would probably never use lol every vodeo haha i m not saying they are not intelligent i m just saying that they will exaggerate a simple sentence,2,1
457,couldn t imagine a better person to tackle these subjects with jp than rb both of their finer qualities shining through being drawn out by each other,3,0
458,peterson is fantastic i have used his works and my challenged his vs my own ideas around said work and my own world experience to inform my counselling practice this has been great when working with men and women alike,5,1

464,i don t understand the issue all we do on this earth is avoid anxiety in various degrees,2,0
465,i have grown my masculine part of my female personality mars in aries 1st house i have been learning about astrology god s knitting pattern the planet mars and the sign aries is our energy drive passion assertiveness it can become toxic via mars being given too much attention which can lead to war and destructive behaviour or mars energy can be repressed leading to depression in both sexes my dd has 4 planets in aries and sun mars conjunction opposite pluto and she used to run up and down the hall to get rid of the restless feeling or she would have a meltdown mars needs action in the body sports dancing drumming competition martial arts etc to vent the energy build up not suppressed via pills,4,1
466,fun times all the interesting stuff thinkers,4,0
467,excellent dr peterson has been ringing the alarm on a lot of things that have been happening for awhile now,5,0
468,russell i will bet you will be thinking about this conversation you had with jordan for a while you are very fortuity to get the opportunity,4,2
469,our ancient gods in greece were also assimilated into the later christianity s demiurgal sainthood and my sicilian friend dante from the aeolian islands told me that the locals still utter a blessing to poseidon for calm seas when they take themselves fishing in their boats,5,1
470,seemed like russel was triggered,2,0
471,introduction to inner city masculinity consists of rap and learning from the biggest thug on the block cuz there is no father,4,1
472,amazing toppic but lets face a fact hetro women look for a male with strong lines of masculinity how can being a manly man can offend others or a more femimine woman can offend others feminism is going to destroy society if a war would happen many women would have to go because less and less men are man enough to go and protect us,4,1
473,this restores faith,5,0
474,i don t necessarily agree with russel but damnit does he have respect,3,0
475,listening to intelligent rational and honest conversation is a balm for the soul thank you,5,2
476,the powerful men have always manipulated women but without that basis women wouldn t be aware of what men mean not that we are animals but we are teachers without knowing completely if at all or maybe we do but women have always been a subject of war because if you kill the household leader you kill the beliefs and that lies within men now just bc i say this doesn t mean you will comprehend it just means you can read at best,3,1
477,neitherof these two has the faintest idea of what it is to be masculine why do they think they do,1,1
478,men talk about this stuff most woman don t,1,0
479,so much pleasure in seeing two honest intellectuals discussing deep stuff,5,0
480,no one bothered to white balance the footage while editing,1,0
481,i can appreciate brand having these conversations even though it s evident which side he s on thank you,4,2
482,russell s point about dietifying the feminine through consumerism marketing is damn good,4,0
483,what did he say,5,0
484,it is interesting juxtaposition that the commercial before this video was the chromebook add with the group of incrediably swissy guys dancing,4,1
485,oops i guess i am a bit of that mom who will just do things for my kid because i do it more efficient faster x,3,0
486,how does the patriarchy play its role in this dynamic russell and his guest as presenting,5,0
487,besides overprotecting parents now we have to deal with overprotecting governments,3,0
488,this is such an archaic reading of gender symbols in culture yes the devouring mother is one archetype the overbearing overprotective figure who needs to mollycoddle their children in order to have a sense of purpose for without them they are gone but gender has changed massively in the turn of the century because the archetype of the overarching omniscient omnipotent father has gone rarely does this archetype exist in a family anymore in fact what we have now is a dislocation in the way men are taught to be providers defenders and strategists but they are not routinely sent out to war anymore and taught to fight in fact the lines between hormonal makeup of both sexes are blurring hence paving the way for less paradoxical and concrete definitions of either this is by cause of nature as a result of nurture the time when these biblical and victorian fables were written were times when men had a great weight of demands and responsibility which society does not demand of them as much anymore before then and in more collectivist societies women were routinely seen as power figures and the bodies were worshipped beyond commodification eg kali goddess of war athena etc also the body would respond hormonally to a man who went to war producing more fight hormones whereas now a man sitting at a desk would not need as high a production level of the fight hormones this poses greater freedom to all genders when deciphering themselves as autonomous beings now somewhat less defined by the parts between their legs but subject to environments and most importantly their choices,1,1
489,i loved this exchange,5,0
490,i feel the use of the female in advertising and comodification in general is the perverted desire to worship the feminine the negated and neglected feminine has found it s expression through consumerism and commerce because it is not being properly honoured socially russell brand on a side note i prefer to feel feminine but do not feel it possible to let it through in the world today i walk down the road in pain with my groceries carless as a female while a man drives past and global warming increases one can feel unattractive it s all so confusing,2,1
491,lol jordan looking slightly annoyed that he didn t come up with the idea that russell came up with regarding advertising and femininity,3,0
492,lol jordan always trying to have it both ways,5,0
493,russel brand for the next uk prime minister,5,0

497,male strength comes from empowering the females in our lives consumerism has replaced male mentoring with buying stuff,5,0
498,i could sit and listen to both of these gentleman and come away 10 pts smarter i do believe,3,1
499,the virgin mary was the feminine energy in christianity and the feminine energy was a lot more worshiped 100 years ago than now be far when we are pushing women to act like man all time and frame everything feminine maternity having kids care as undesirable what we have now is everyone is confused and doesn t know how to behave with each other as all the social strucutres of yesterday have been artificially brocken from the highers ups down using media insitutions and social pressure,1,1
500,look someone asking questions and hearing the answers talking to jordan peterson this is a pretty new experience to be honest,4,1
501,except 56 of global youtube users are male 44 are female,1,0
502,always said the main problem with western society is the over protective mother it creates emasculated men who then turn out to be explosive rage aholoics who can t express their emotions properly which in turn causes chaos in all their relationships if you put an s in front of mother it becomes smother,1,1
503,i really enjoy these talks can you please do more with jordan peterson i believe this is really important stuff to be talked about,5,2
504,the statement from jordan that youtube users are 80 male is just wrong,1,0
505,talking masculinity with a man who sports a man bun,4,0
506,yep my sister ruined her kids by doing everything for them and i d ask why dont u let them whatever themselves her answer was its easier and faster to jist do it myself i saidnuea but they aren t learning anything yea that went over well but the development of a human being is to teach them as much as u can let them struggle getting themselves dressed when they achieve it they ll never need u to do it again and this is the same for anything u teach them and let them try then succeed even at 3 and 4 u can give them a chore then as time goes u add some and its not about the actually chore its about becoming knowledgeable of being responsible for things as u grow where chores are jist part of life not the end of the world by the time ur 14 and ur fighting to get ur kid to clean their rooms,3,1
507,wearing the mask is entering the trail of tears taking the jab is entering the reservation the educational system is now a network of residential schools teaching compliance to the global corporate masters who see humanity as indians living in the wilderness that needs to be tamed and reset restructured all those square plots of land sold to the settlers long ago are now being stolen back by the global pharaohs,5,1
508,oh u mean yen and yang that s needs to be balanced like in our whole life,3,1
509,woman who claim to be strong amd independent are acting under masculinity,1,0
510,if he was targeting men his book would be geared towards men and it doesn t,2,1
511,omg i pray for the day man buns go out of style,3,0
512,ballance within the self of these forces is what is necessary for good health,4,0
513,post whole interview to youtube please,1,0
514,there is also definitely something going on with femininity too it s just a lot of being pushed in confusing directions and feeling you want to assert some sort of power and control but in all sorts of contradictory ways,2,1
515,what are people talking about go open your third eye with psychedelics experience the spiritual world obtain spiritual enlightenment stop listening to bs on youtube,1,0
516,lots of love and very best wishes to our likeable lovely character russell brand god bless you even more,5,2
517,sometimes i think that power and humiliation is a human need it s just not in the mazlow pyramid it would be on the bottom we basically live in a mass psychosis with a primitive intuition unconscious and a overly positive persona carl jung said something like the biggest threat of mankind is a mass psychosis which i think we live in right now i mean for example we never got teached in school about dominance hierarchies or how to go through live without depression and anxiety it s like no one ever wants you to be a confident strong human not your teachers not your parents no one so we live in a hammer and nails society right so there is per definition always a winner and a loser and if you re a loser lets say you get depressed do drugs and suicide its totally wanted by everyone around you so it s absolutely no wonder that these things are on the rise absolutely no wonder,1,1
518,been waiting and thinking about this collaboration for ages,5,0
519,the peterson person preaches something to deal with that he has never been able to deal with clinical depression he is so desperate to be visible that it just getting sick the most importantly he said just get that shot and this tell all who he is you discredit yourself by inviting him to give interview enough of circulation of lies and circular support of one liners by another am unsubscribing from your channel and other who support truth should do the same,1,1
520,female conscription to off shore wars is 82yrs over due,1,0
521,peterson s statistics on youtube users are simply wrong while more users are male than female globally it s nowhere near his 80 56 of global youtube users are male 44 of global youtube users are female and in the us 82 of male adults use youtube and curiosity,1,0
522,i am a woman and i ve lived a very difficult life so as a result of that i had to develop a lot of masculinity but right now i am in a beautiful space in my life where i am finally mostly in my feminine energy and can switch on my masculine when i see necessary my boyfriend also had a difficult upbringing but that has made him very loving and sweet but lost touch with his get go mode it was many difficult conversations to make him see that masculinity is not being expressed i am stressed at times because he s so chilled out and i take on way too much responsibility like i said he s the sweetest boy in the world and would do anything for me so he s realising it slowly i feel so blessed to live my life with him,3,1
523,it s great that you re having the conversations it ll benefit him more in the long run to be balanced in his healthy masculine energy rather than operating in his feminine too much hope you both enjoy many loving years together,5,2
524,cooool love this talk could listen to this go on for ages,5,0
525,the masculinity is developed enough in women thanks to being raised by single mothers and having no respect for the male leadership role this whole independent woman thing has been born out of that,5,1
526,i made it up it s a good idea though isn t it russel reminds me of the children i take care of at daycare when they want to show me something they re really proud of to see that spirit in an adult man was kind of wholesome,3,1
527,that was so sweet,1,0

531,this sort of free thinking and discussion is just brilliant and frankly a great relief given all of the agenda driven discourse that we ve been flooded with thank you so much i love your passion and honesty whether or not i agree with you at any given point,5,2
532,i agree with most things in this discussion i would also bring into question about most italian mothers and their relationship with their sons as well as cultures where it is the norm to live in extended families married sons with their wives and mother s etc and for many it works i believe there should be a balance with attachment in all relevant relationships having said this my own relationship with my mother can be likened to one of the worst examples of narcissistic and sadistic parental abuse your children come from you not belong to you khalil gibran,1,1
533,yeah unfortunately it s something that needs to be more widely understood at least because you understand the dynamics you can strive to change it for the future generations in your ancestral line with healthy balanced relationships extended family and community plays such a role in thriving unfortunately many of us don t have it so we re locked into all sorts of manipulations when it comes to narcissistic relationships you have to severe ths ties for your own sanity and autonomy,3,1

547,it isn t true there s no place for femininity in the trinity it s clear stated both wo man and man express and are carriers of god s image equally and god has many names among them some which express motherly traits he is a father and most studies show how crucial the father figure is sex or gender is definately not a characteristic of spiritual beings only earthly creatures the lord jesuscrist was a man that s of course historically and culturally relevant to the time of his first coming,1,1

555,youtube literally tells you in your stats of the videos by gender and age,5,2
556,is the issue of masculinity the thing it s self which is expressed differently in each man n women but the fact it s got a male noun a strong name that s synonymous with men so when women are display masculine traits they are tom boys etc instead are we not wanting to promote inner strength personality ability to stand up for them selves whether it s a man or women son or daughter i feel the antiquated word and associated description conjure negative images based on historic use and men it s been attributed to,1,1

574,russell i m so glad that you had a discussion with this person i read one of his books recently you re amazing in this interview incredibly respectful this label of toxic masculinity is definitely revolting in saying that i do not agree with a lot of what this person says certainly there is masculinity in all of us i m still not entirely sure what he means by it as he does say quite mad stuff watch his channel l 4 interview like youtube is primarily male as a female i m pretty sure that s not true i find many of his ideologies very confusing and purely egotistical he s an incredibly interesting figure though keep giving a voice to all peace x,1,1
575,i m glad i m not as smart as doc peterson the man can t sit down and watch a bleedin movie without psycho analyzing it,3,0
576,i d love to get to russell s powerful ability to learn challenge and construct insightful and deversed dialogue the problem with today s person is everyone is so overly sensitive it s very difficult to have a conversation with someone who refuses to be challenged on their perspectives don t even get me started on echo chambers like steven crowder and matt walsh i dislike the left but man there s something about those two which is sicken,2,1
577,russell i could never express how much i love the path you re on absolutely jaw dropping to watch a conversation between to wonderful minds about what is right instead of who is right,1,2
578,the thing i can t stand about peterson is that he misrepresents history communism wasn t really that popular until the nations of europe plunged their populations into world war 1 causing mass death famine and exacerbating the spanish flu pandemic when capitalism gets out of control it causes communism to happen i m not endorsing either system i m just explaining that one is caused by the other moreover communist governments mostly kill people in their own countries whereas capitalist governments have done it mostly in other people s countries stalin killed millions in russia ukraine and poland anti communist nazi germany also killed millions in russia ukraine and poland my dad walked over fields of corpses in vietnam we committed a genocide there because we said that they don t have the right to be communists even in their own country so we went there and killed millions of people spraying agent orange and poisoning generations to come go look at the photos of the baby sometimes but don t do it before you have to eat anything,1,1

588,peterson has provided a response to the women s lib now it s all men s fault movement of the last half century while there has been so much support and effort for women and minorities and so much blame for white men it can be hard to see that for some white men of gen x and increasing numbers of men in gens y and z there has been an uphill battle to find a niche or acceptable role to play in society at large many fail to see how much of this is really an economic struggle with the top 1 and the oligarchs sucking so much out of the economy that poor white men of today have enough of a hard time struggling like everyone else let alone taking the blame for the efforts of our forefathers i went to berkeley tons and tons of brilliant students however there was an almost toxic attitude toward even healthy dare i say ideal expectation that men must also advance in the global society this is also true with the increase of focus belated though it is for attention to the lgbtqxyz etc segments of society who until recently have been nearly invisible though i understand and appreciate the need to have paid attention and increased awareness of all these groups it can be kind of hard hearing for almost all of my life close to 50 years the men are bad and are responsible for all the ills of the world i am deeply relieved that someone like dr peterson came to the rescue of the male agenda and am also deeply appreciative that someone as brilliant as mr brand has provided opportunities for his fans to be exposed to the ideas and responses of dr peterson,3,1

590,in the holy trinity the holy spirit is feminine say so in the ancient texts,3,1
591,interesting my mind went to lady wisdom in proverbs,4,0
592,yes the tetragrammaton maps a tetrahedron geometrically if you have 3 points of a perfect tetrahedron the 4th point is implied mathematically and known in the name of god aka the tetragrammaton there are four letters yod heh vau heh yod is the point of origin and corresponds to the male heh is the space around the point of origin geometrically expressed by the radius from the origin this is why female is a vessel the womb you see this in reproductive geometry too sperm are tiny like the origin point and the egg is huge like the sphere determined around the origin then you have vau which means son but is the repeat of the original male origin point but is 90 degrees out of phase rotationally with the original origin point the 4th point is heh again which is the female again the consort of the son or the sister as in apollo and athena but that second female is implied not in to lower the female aspect but simply because it is the 4th point geometrically the 90 degree phase shift of the second pair of points is where spin comes from you must have the male and the female 1st two points to have polarity and you must have the second pair to get movement and spin the 4th point is necessary but is implied by the geometry of the first 3 points the first 3 points correspond to the holy trinity,2,1

595,i really like how you presented an idea as not fact but as something that should be explored to determine if it holds up to scrutiny that way of phrasing is a great way to keep your ideas separate from your beliefs and insulates you from being attacked out of context,4,2
596,jordan may be correct to some extent about his audience i know multiple women who like peterson s work the divisor on his work is the self determined versus those less oriented that way we have a colloquial word for that we call it based based is not a political trait it means to be actualized to seek actualization and to therefore value actualization the emperor s new clothes,3,1
597,hi russell i wonder if there is any possibility that you become my mentor please i would love to have some guide in my life and i kind of swallow every word you say in your talks i feel like i have known you for decades on an spiritual level,4,2

602,fascinating more more more,5,0
603,the mistake people make is equating abusiveness with anything masculine masculine energy is sexy in men don t give it up for the loudest and angriest voices as a powerful woman i want a powerful man and shudder at the castration of male characters in movies and tv these days and the way men in certain communities even talk with higher voices to avoid being threatening people who hate masculine also overlook the potency of the feminine the classic abilities to artfully and subtly get whatever we want i think people forget about the gentleman someone who nearly serves a lady and is totally respectful while retaining his masculinity he wants to provide and protect even if she could totally do it all of her own duh men who abuse are abusers not masculine a may equal b but b doesn t necessarily equal a something like that p,1,1
604,also myself and a friend of mine have stopped dating usa born and raised guys favoring men from countries where being a man hasn t been made wrong north american men are almost disrespectful in how equally they treat us guys from other countries know how to treat a girl like a princess or queen,1,1

617,when i was kid my family had chickens for many years we had roosters coming and going because majority of them were agressive attacking others which turned them into chicken soup then we get this one rooster who since birth was different and example of true leader and masculinity he didn t attack humans or other animals except other roosters if they misbehaved he didn t discriminate and took care for old chickens and eggs when chicken mother went to eat he kept them warm until mother returned which no other rooster did raised orphan chicks under his wings and let them sit on his back when we let them free to roam he fed all his chickens called them when found better food and at evening he get them back in barn he was good to us kids didn t get angry when he was involuntary put on kid swings or dressed up for being such amazing rooster he had special privileges and all food he could wish for so he grew up in size of small turkey and had long life until he died of old age that bird was embodiment of true masculinity and earned leadership in shape of rooster,5,1
618,this is awesome and got to father many chicks i assume,5,0
619,in these discussions the elimination of god and the devil hinders the equation which is what appears you are searching for the equation is simple god made man in an image of himself masculinity comes from god masculine men tend to be leaders women who are also leaders appear masculine when it comes to the question of using women for advertising discussed around the 4 30 mark the solution is quite simple the devil is the prince of this world and he uses the 7 deadly sins of man to entice our minds and souls away from god using women for advertising satisfies lust men lusting over the women envy other women wanting to be like the models greed companies benefiting from using the women anger triggering people out of peace and into anger which is a low vibrational energy gluttony over consuming products in such excess that one does not need there is no empowerment in this type of advertising it is truly the devils work,4,1

634,attacking masculinity is not good for women not that long ago there was a series of articles with professional women lamenting the shortage of financially suitable male partners two things to unpack 1 that women still view men at least in part in terms of their earning providing capacity but also 2 how the idea to empower women became a zero sum game in practice college enrollments skew majority female today historically women have married at an equal or higher economic level whereas men have traditionally married at an equal or lower level that of course was before opportunities for women became more widespread fewer men in college means fewer at the equal higher economic level at least in a professional sense it is not often that a college educated woman marries an electrician carpenter welder or other tradesman who makes a nice living,2,1

645,i love these guys,5,0
646,i love russell and i m so glad i subscribed i m a conservative and i often don t agree with what he is saying but at least he can have a civil conversation that makes some sense to me oh and jordan he s fabulous brilliant,5,1
647,what ever happened to the marbarl man,5,0
648,it feels like women aren t allowed to act feminine these days as it is seen as being weak and childish you can still be independent and in charge of your own life without having to act tough all the time isn t it better to have a bit of both masculine and feminine traits the same with men i think guys with masculine traits are great but i also like guys who also have a vulnerable side,3,1
649,what russell said about feminine being perverted struck me the first time i heard it in the full conversation and it still sounds like the absolute truth,5,1
650,when does interesting insight into the human condition become pointless pretentious pontification i dunno,2,0
651,love jordan b peterson he is so wise i m one of the females who follows listens,5,0
652,only he will deserve the name of man and can count upon anything prepared for him from above who has already acquired corresponding data for being able to preserve intact both the wolf and the sheep confided to his care george ivanovich gurdjieff,3,1
653,i loved this i ve navigated between all sorts of different ideologies and couldn t ever quite find the answers i needed neutral discussions like these are so great for exploring new ideas i ve always had issues with the patriarchy but couldn t entirely support the misandrist attitude many feminist movements usually carry with them extreme femininity and total rejection of the masculine can also be detrimental to people s well being i know this first hand as an abuse survivor who grew up with a crazy borderline mother we need to learn to embrace the positive aspects of masculinity and feminity and reject the toxic ones there always needs to be a balance between these two energies in all of us as both can spiral out of control,5,1
654,oh god same the feminist movement has great ideas of course but not only a lot of those who are part of it are misandrists also the movement has left out women of color and focused on white women for so long,1,1
655,great to see peterson back and brand is evolving nicely,5,0
656,masculinity in females is not what we need the feminist movement did that and now look at us female s need to go back to their femininity and males need to get back to their masculinity every gender has their part to play in life and both are equally important look at the animal kingdom they are not confused hell we are devolving,1,1
657,i can see why men prefer him women want a seat at the table and to be part of the great universal myths too jordan just never invites them,2,1
658,he s always omitting female roles in narratives i once heard him tell the story of horus and osiris and entirely omit isis s part from the tale little suspicious,2,0
659,everytime i hear anyone mention the divine feminine to jordan we quickly tumble into a dark place with the devouring terrible mother archetype,5,0
660,i don t dislike jordan peterson but can he stop saying youtube is almost only used by men what i looked up showed 56 male and 44 female he s been using that line for years and it s always bothered me it s fine to have a mostly male audience but stop saying women aren t using youtube,3,1
661,masculinity is relevant because you get those men who are calm and collected but you also get those who are macho they are all men at the end of the day if the macho man knocks out the calm and collected then he owns them and cancels the calm ones out at the end of the day it s about who can knock out who in a bare darwinian sense any civil sense of pointing out the mature and sensible ones that are true men well that s a social construct that came with civility but there is also a side of pure animal and primeval of fists and egotism which was how kingdoms and domains were calved out in ancient times,2,1
662,but isn t the great bugaboo of all time is the feminine expression in men the mortal sin for boys is to show any qualities judged as feminine more condemned then the expression of masculinity in girls both are often punished but girls can play sports boys still cant play with dolls,3,1

667,can you learn to be masculine,5,2
668,i m glad you are starting a tribe russell no one else is stepping up i m a woman who has been in support of what jp has been saying for a few years now i ve also noticed the importance of supporting men young men and masculinity this enables women to be more feminine also re your comment about the neglected feminine and females used for advertising i heard that men operate on a more visual level and therefore if masculinity operates more on the visual level then this is a reason why using females in advertising appeals to both sexes if we have both masculine and feminine within,5,1

677,that s haram for peterson,1,0
678,jordan is a canadian embarrassment,1,0
679,masculinity had to be disempowered the alpha had to be marginalised so that an age of sheepish compliance could ensue,2,1
680,excuse me women far from need any form of masculinity tho if you re talking about fighting combat etc that all comes under the feminine,1,2
681,this was great to revisit i can t wait for these two to do another podcast together,5,0
682,how did a discussion about masculinity end up discussing the devouring mother myth it has been easy to blame beleaguered mothers when fathers have largely been absent due to the imperative to fulfil their largely constructed by establishment manipulation societal masculine functions such as cannon fodder wage slavery and striving to become the alpha male within the malthusian social darwinian landscape that is the neo liberal economic horror show we inhabit we are animals that are mammals first human beings homo sapiens second and male female or somewhere on the continuum thirdly we are a part of our environment not apart from our environment that is what needs to be learnt by the hyper masculine structures we are forced to live under competition domination the cult of the narcissist are all manifestations of the priorities of a world out of balance and the danger of being out of balance is there will be a fall that will affect all,2,1
683,i love russell i really respect peterson,5,0
684,true masculinity is a good thing men devoid of it become weak and therefore toxic spiteful and abusive,1,1
685,could listen to these 2 for days,4,0
686,i honestly think demonizing men or women is stupid the honest truth is thoughtful people in general are hard to find and most people are running around with some version of ptsd whether they know it or not,2,1
687,thanks for posting this and the link to the full interview fascinating discussion covering a lot of ground given that it goes back a few years i wonder whether dr peterson s position on the spiritual has moved closer to yours after his own recent experiences,4,1
688,the majority of us are so incredibly fortunate to be at a time in civilization that meaning can be found in conversations such as this,5,1

693,jordan peterson the man who has an opinion on absolutely everything oddly has no opinion on the plandenic or the death jab in fact he has been largely missing in action my conclusion he is a giant fraud,1,0

704,russel is one of the few individuals that is bridging the gap between people that the culture war has destroyed good work,4,1
705,men don t need guidance but we seem to be constantly bombarded with thie idea that we really really really do from those who aren t men the neglected feminine also expresses itself in other ways for example being rubbish at parking a car inverse punctuality gossiping whinging femsplaining and the inability to see humour in stupid youtube comments,1,1
706,fairy godmother it s up to you to get back before midnight cinderella placing the responsibility on the child,4,2
707,let him talk,5,0
708,yeah i always feel that about the trinity i can t seem to stabilise it is the holy spirit neutral as conventionally claimed or a feminine energy analogous to the shekinah but then how can mary be impregnated by a female energy are we going to have to wait for jesus s return in female form to balance the equation i speak as a confused christian feminist who often thinks they will vomit if they hear about god the father one more time let alone repeat it through gritted teeth and anyway any creator worthy of the name surely should never be anthropomorphised in this way tho i sorta like the image of mary as queen of heaven which means she must have a male counterpart but then i m back to the male sky god thing also she has a counterpart in buddhism guanyin or kuanyin or kanon depending on where you are and she s based on the hermaphroditic buddhist hindu avalokitesvra the compassionate buddha,1,1
709,my youtube audience is 50 50 male female s haaaah i win lol,1,0
710,pure gold give me more,5,0
711,russell and jordan you gotta thank god for having a good running memory to remember a lot of stuff,5,2
712,sleeping beauty is about the girl coming of age has to stay virgin too long so she becomes depressed not beeing allowed to express her femininity she is alive but dead inside the godmother is the symbol of culture staying virgin too long because the family only thinks a prince is good enough not a neighbor boy or gardener or plumber so finally the prince knocks her up the story is told to girls with the message if you wait longer you might get a partner who is a greater catch its from the time when girls couldnt improve their own status or forfill their ambitions with their own career it had to be via the man so all you could do is stay there and look beautifull sleeping beauty is about just that objectified as beauty that is the only thing you can be a body her mind is asleep she is only a beautifull body if that curse isnt broken she will die,2,1
713,what is masculinity isn t it cultural and contextual isn t it a belief,1,0
714,the netherlands lost their most devine masculin man peter r de vries proud containing crimefighter journalist legal advisor elevating victims and changing the legal system a hero his courage made everyone around him step it up and not accept defeat and never give up to clean the country from organized crime we must call their bluf and stand tall in his memory an icon against cowardism,5,1

735,and listen to,5,1
736,sorry to be so benign but i simply love russell,5,0
737,thank you for this russell i feel like i m growing older and wiser with you and i love you for it i m far beyond this now but it s still invaluable which is a testament to it s importance thank you,5,2
738,i love the combination of you two speaking it s the best,5,2
739,the reason why the elite are using all their controlled resources like media and education via political control against masculinity is that emasculated feminine men don t pull the increasingly totalitarian elite from their ivory towers as they have in the past,2,1
740,i think he s thinking about it backwards his message hit so hard because it resonated so strongly with the youtube audience his success is partly because his message went to the exact place it was needed,2,1
741,peterson brand two beacons of light in an era of darkness,5,0
742,that statistic about more men then woman on youtube is complete rubbish why would he think that it s not easily debunked what a con artist,1,0
743,jp is one of the most intelligent idiots of modern times,5,0
744,so true children are very impressionable and gullible and we take everything our parents do say and teach us to be the absolute truth without question the way we are raised as children greatly affects how we act and view the world when we become adults most parents are young people in their 20 s who dont realy know how to raise a child except for their own personal experiences with their parents to guide them many of us blame our parents for the way we are but when we become a little older we realise that their is no one to blame for our own ignorance except ourselves learn from it and try to do better with our own children,5,1
745,and yet socially who is winning groups or individuals yeah there s strength in groups never forget that the point of the individual like christ is that he can transcend the tendencies of the group and set a new path for groups but what happened to the individual himself he got tortured ridiculed placed on a cross and murdered it wasn t until much later that his individual message became transcendent thanks to people picking it up and sharing it to groups now if you want to argue metaphysically christ s transcendence comes from redeeming humanity sure but i was talking pragmatically here on earth,1,1
746,straight men have never been responsible for the gorgeous women in advertising and the unattainable body images in mannequins etc gay men and women run fashion and advertising departments,1,1
747,i disagree ursula and some others peterson mentioned are the wise old crone archetype who teaches the life death life cycle they teach that in order for some things to grow others have to be sacrificed its the spirit of the earth sure mother gaia but not in the over protective ways he alludes to check out women who run with the wolves if you d like to learn more,3,1
748,and bambi clearly the devouring mother but don t worry he ll have a rationalization for that too because in no event can it not be the devouring mother if that s the context chosen for the instant argument peterson is a doublethink jedi root to stem he says a whole lot that is correct on a factual or study level and then uses it to subvert and has mastered the art of attempting to rhetorically justify espousing contradictory positions simultaneously he has an agenda while pretending not to and it s unfortunate because he could do better and because pretending to be objective to hide not being objective is a special kind of dishonesty,4,1
749,hey russell died his hair,1,0
750,the jordan peterson can so clearly describe the masculine and it s importance for both men and women was super insightful liked russell s calling out the worship of the feminine due to absence of spirituality that s deep,4,1
751,i never pictured russell as a thinker until recently you have my respect sir,5,2
752,i think reason why ouens are watching more youtube videos is because they are searching for a proper pathway to masculinity in other words they are looking for a proper role model in how to be a man reason being there aren t good male role models,3,1
753,hard to see why they banned some of jordans content,2,0
754,nonsense the fairy god mother used magic to give everything to cinderella i could make up supposed correlations between the male and female and disney movies much more insightful than this peterson is no philosopher for sure,1,1
755,anyone who knows what the word substrate means and doesn t have the capacity to use another more common word to describe his point of view is a poser plain and simple,2,1
756,there s no place for the divine feminine in the holy trinity me father son holy ghost man woman child i really don t think this man looked into this some people consider the holy ghost to be feminine,1,1
757,its fabulous to be listening to an intelligent conversation even if it had sleeping beauty and the little mermaid as talking points,5,1
758,to me the difference between jp and rb is jp first and foremost has his eye on his image and retaining his identity as an authority in the intellectual field whereas rb first and foremost is interested in expanding and exploring the ideas in the discussion itself so its uncomfortable for me to see rb seek jp s judgement on his ideas as he is asking someone who is inferior to him in the development of ideas imo this is from quite a while ago i think but rb please rather look up to people who are open hearted as their guiding principle in conversation not guarding a brittle self identification with intellect,3,1
759,no no how can you listen too this guy can t you see he s a bigot,1,2
760,uhmmm two smart dudes discussing sleeping beauty and the little mermaid awesome,5,0
761,peterson is saying problems arise when we don t invite in make space for the devouring mother crone witch feminine chaos whatever you want to call it i e sleeping beauty ends up unconscious based on the myth he s referencing if the devouring mother is a problem in our society is this not evidence that something might be lacking an invitation maybe peterson spends his time advocating against the overmothering behaviors archetype yeah dude duh maleficent is powerful and vengeful and scary we know he also acknowledges the feminine has both positive and negative arcs i e fairy godmother and evil witch so what would have happened if sleeping beauty s parents apologized to maleficent and invited her to the next party what if we advocated for the witch to be invited in the first place so we don t spend the rest of the movie aka our lives fighting oh right because we love the drama of it all it wouldn t be a good movie if we didn t have a bad villain in real life if we want meaningful change we have to stop making villains out of each other it seems to me peterson would rather keep making his point overmothering is bad rather than thoughtfully engage with the devouring mother herself if i were having an intimate conversation with peterson myself i would ask him what if you actually love being devisive and controversial what if you truly enjoy getting strong reactions from people by belabouring emotional difficult topics with evasive and academic language what if you accepted you are really good at doing just that and what if that is a totally normal and amazing phenomenon and what would happen if we observed it and savored it and used in a cooler more effective way why deny the drama you bring it with you everywhere,1,1
762,russell could you interview dr david martin he is the fact man you really need on all of your sides right now goggle exclusive dr david martin ends covid 19 this is just sad when the justice system has failed us all been watching him since he started this checked all his work and is all true and as you know i am pro truth,1,2

764,i m a woman love youtube love men thank god we aren t all female i have 3 amazing sons am so proud of how they are maturing we have different strengths weaknesses need each other healthy partnerships can be beautiful,5,0
765,the divine male and sacred feminine seem to be missing in our modern world,5,1
766,that s not true that the youtube audience is all male and yes they do use sexuality in commercial advertising the mans hot body and the females hot body sex sells duh harry potter is the most demonic movie books ever written it s not safe to have children even read harry potter those are all real spells in that book witches and demons no no no this jordan guy is dangerous,1,1
767,thank you for addressing that there is a very masculine element to jordan peterson i ve always thought so too also i m a woman and i m ok with you being you as always intelligent interesting and important,4,2
768,brain food,4,0
769,russell is kinda hot,3,0
770,russel thank you for staying yourself and sharing such interesting conversations i love hearing you think out loud so smartly and humbly i hope to meet you one day and chat,5,2
771,it s nice to hear people freely debating their ideas beliefs without disowning each other forever or being kicked off of social media everyone is entitled to their ideas and opinions and everyone deserves to be peacefully heard thank you,5,1
772,hello how are you,5,2
773,masculinity and femininity are not related to gender in jungian terms it might more easily be digested as yang and yin however indeed the terms are muddled as we are all children of patriarchy so what does masculine and feminine mean from this cultural context a delightful exchange about the archetypes in fairytales,3,1
774,i find jordan peterson to be a creep and a weirdo,3,0
775,blech can t stand that egotistical dude,1,0
