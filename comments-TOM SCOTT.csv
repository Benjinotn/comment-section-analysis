Doug Weiss,"I love how ""human intervention causes harm"" is used as an explanation for why these thriving Carp are a bad thing, and yet putting an electric fence underwater to direct entire ecosystems of fish, at a price tag surely of 10s of millions of dollars per year of taxpayer money, likely more, is somehow not a ""human intervention [that] causes harm."" Who cares if the Carp are dominating the ecosystem? They look edible to me. As far as getting hit in the face by a flying fish, I guess you would have to stop going 40 miles an hour down the lake 16 hours a day. How tragic. Imagine all the tubers and water-skiers who would be so gravely oppressed by the evil Carp were they allowed to roam free and pursue their natural fate and destiny. Let me guess, the author also believes climate change is going to sink Florida and England by 2030. The gaslighting never ends. The real victims here are people living in the area who have to hear the noise pollution of incessant recreational boating at high speeds and the taxpayers who continue to be robbed deaf by the perpetually expanding, inefficient, ineffective, misdirected, largest most profligate corporations on Earth known as governments.",2022-09-11T17:07:51Z,0,0

kenneth pearson,"why not catch them in giant nets and use them as the much needed fertilizer in our farming industry? Large cranes on each sid of the canal could lower their nets until full of fish, then raise the catch and swing the haul to one side to be loaded into waiting trailers for delivery to the fertilizer plant where they would be initially processed through large chippers (similar to wood chippers in a papermill) then slurried into a drying and packaging plant. The initial investment would be huge but the profits would be enormous considering what fertilizer cost these days. Many large farms would probably accept the slurry in tankers to be directly applied to their acreage. Back at the canal you would need several locations along the canal to insure while one net is being harvested another one upstream or down straem would be ready to catch the fish. If a vessel needs passage the nets could be raised in turn to allow it access.",2022-09-05T22:16:29Z,0,0

Aye Bee,"Carp problems?
Years ago I watched two guys with a flat bottom John Boat. They built an air thruster fan which used a 4hp horizontal petrol engine. Tiller steering.

Kate go,"Wait, so the thing is super deadly to humans but a mere inconvenience or temporary knock-out for the fish? I don't understand...
My uneducated, simple mind proposes a different plan. Interrupt the canal by closing a section and filling it with concrete. Have two canal-wide boat ramps on either side and install a type of conveyer belt/caterpillar tracks, kind of like on army tanks. Get the whole thing working on solar or wind power, and make it super resilient (the army people are good at that). Then you can have barges being pulled out of the water and back in on the other side while the fish can't. This could work on anything with a somewhat flat bottom or a fin that is removable. Sailboats, kayaks, and canoes would not be able to cross it but they can cross it by taking their vessel out of the water like they always do and they're not cargo carriers anyways.

Now4,"While this video is great- it doesn‚Äôt mention a huge issue, which is mis-identifying common carp (naturalized in the US) and Buffalo (similar to a carp, native to the US and extremely similar to carp) as the serious invasive species of silver carp or bighead carp. This has caused a witchhunt for these mostly harmless species, simply because they are carp as well. So many people will just kill any carp they come across because they think any carp is invasive, and its terrible when this occurs.

In that sense, while the video is great for calling out this issue of asian carp in these waters, I think you should‚Äôve said something specifying that there is this other issue as well, as I can guarantee that people will see this video and further be influenced to believe all carp are the issue and catch and kill them, which is just not correct. 

So please, on the chance that you catch a carp, please know that if its not an asian or bighead carp, there is absolutely 0 reason to kill it. In fact, its best to release them as they are incredibly fun to catch and don‚Äôt hurt the ecosystem at all!",2022-08-28T21:49:52Z,36,2

Nevin Scanlan,"@Tumblevveed I'm guessing it's a combination of the fish getting stunned downstream before the voltage gets too high, as well as the fish being able to survive underwater once its been stunned. If a person survived being stunned, they would still likely perish from drowning.",2022-09-05T17:51:11Z,7,
Tumblevveed,"@Davis White My best guess is because of the 2.3V per inch in the water. A fish is a lot shorter and narrower than a human. At 6 feet, the potential difference on a person that tall would be 165 volts from head to toe if your facing the right direction while a 1 foot long fish may experience up to a 28 volt potential difference from head to tail if facing the same direction as the electrical current is flowing in the water. At 6 volts, that would be way more if your over the higher voltage barrier. We also have a lot more surface area than a fish which may pass more current through us than a fish.

""But isn't this electric barrier keeping the carp OUT?""
1.) No. Watch the video. They mention how they've found some carp INSIDE the great lakes even after this was installed.
2.) In theory, yes. But the video itself mentions how when barges go through fish in-between them can safely enter into the lake.
3.) It doesn't take into account things like birds diving down, catching carp, dropping them in the great lakes and those carp then spawning and thus rendering the electrified fence pointless.
4.) They have generators on site, but they doesn't last forever without constant resupply of fuel - so electricity in times of natural disaster are an issue. Also... floods don't care if a small tiny portion of your river is electrified. And the system DOES have to go down for maintenance sometimes or can have failures.

Ryan McGowan,"It seems like they could make such a system portable, and gradually move it up the river until all the carp are cordoned off to a small region where they could eventually be removed entirely. At some point, they could make another permanent barrier 20 miles up the river, keep it going until you've cleared the entire watershed.",2022-08-26T08:14:31Z,24,10
WTF LMAA,"@Ryan McGowan You aren't making much sense. 
If you move the barrier 10 miles upstream as you suggested then you are _increasing_ the habitat by this much, not shrinking it. 
And if you move the barrier downstream ""to shrink the habitat"" then you will hit the Des Plaines River within a few miles and a bit farther down the Illinois and then eventually the Mississippi rivers with all their tributaries.",2022-09-04T01:02:44Z,1,
WTF LMAA,"@Anthony Tips 
I don't get it. What do you gain by moving this barrier by 10 miles? Or even 100 miles? The carp is still in the Mississippi and you still need to stop it from migrating into the Great Lakes through this canal.
""until you've cleared the entire watershed"": this watershed _is_ the Mississippi river basin, as least as far as the environmental conditions are right for the carp to live there.",2022-09-04T00:25:00Z,1,

Eidako,Also if you're wondering why electricity would preferentially travel through a living thing rather than the water that's all around it: a human body is 4000 ppm salt. River water is 120 ppm salt. Electricity flows much easier through saline than fresh water.,2022-08-26T06:16:30Z,0,
Eidako,"Size. Electricity flows from areas of high potential to low potential. A gradient of these potentials exists in the water, e.g. 5 4 3 2 1 0 -1 -2 -3 -4 -5. A fish or bird is only large enough to bridge a small difference in potentials, e.g. 5 4 (3 2 1) 0 -1 -2 -3 -4 -5 for a difference of 2. A human can act as a much larger bridge, e.g. 5 4 (3 2 1 0 -1 -2 -3) -4 -5 for a difference of 6. The bigger the difference, the bigger the zap.",2022-08-26T06:03:53Z,0,

My reason for stating the obvious, in this case is to spur others into giving the situation some thought.  There may be other solutions not yet considered.  For instance... when controlling populations of malarial mosquitos, genetically modified individuals, which produce sterile larvae upon mating, are introduced to the local environment.  This tactic drastically lowers the rate of population increase for that mosquito species.

In the study done, it seems that the birds were fed 500 eggs each, with 18 eggs coming out the other end intact with a live embryo inside. Of those 18, only 3 ended up actually hatching. If you multiply that by the number of birds in a flock then that still gives you a lot of fish, but it's possible that going through a bird's digestive tract affects the embryo enough that it's unlikely to survive to adulthood even if it does hatch...more research is needed there.",2022-08-27T18:12:51Z,5,

Paul Jeannides,"Many years ago, the commercial fishermen over fished the great lakes, I would guess by netting with power boats, AKA,  commercial fishing boats. The harvest of millions of carp caught  by netting. Would need to be processed into a product. What product could the massive  catches be used for? As a lay person, I would guess cat food, feed of some sort? Etc.  If the catches have no value, then the Corp of engineers could fish them by contracting sub contractors to do the job. And research an end use product.  Who knows what product the substrate carp could be used for?  I believe that it's just a matter of time that the carp will win the battle. I recently heard that they found their way into Lake Calumet.  So next stop is Lake Michigan.  Don't the birds carry eggs on their rumps, and spread the fish in the process of flying over to a Virgin body of water. How about a gravity suction, into the deep tunnel and catch the fish, and dump them into the processing operation?  Paul Jeannides",2022-08-25T13:40:30Z,0,0

Noname,Well this is dumb there is an easier solution. Create a belt to carry the stuff around why do you need water when a belt would definitely the same job? And by belt i mean similar to that of a suppermarket cashier. And move the goods on land that way. And it can be done right where the canal is at. As for the swage it should be treated and deposited on the ground anyways so the fact that they are still tossing garbage in the riverways is criminal. They have the reasources to create a water cleaning tank and just toss the waters back to the aquifer and let nature take care of the rest. You don't need to trow garbage on the rives.  And if anything just make a lift to raise the boats cross blockade that will cut the canal underwater put a real fence at 2mm holes so just the water goes by and change that once a week make 3 layers and it will be cheaper than having all that electrical stuff in the water. The nets or fence can be recycled and reused. You can clean them up and reuse em and no fish not even eggs can go through them. That way its 100% safe. There you go a few easy solutions and don't tell me it can't be done.,2022-08-25T13:02:16Z,0,0

There is some depth to this thing and to blow in air will need a lot of pressure. If you had a straw going to the bottom of the canal you couldn't even blow air through it.

Meaning less diversity, possibly worse water quality etc. In the grand scheme of things over thousands of years it doesn't make a difference of course, a different version of the ecosystem will balance itself out. However short-term there can be devastating consequences for tourism and health in the area. Also the lakes might not be able to hold as much CO2 etc.",2022-08-26T13:21:15Z,7,

Eidako,"According to the website of a company that worked on the project, it was designed to have a 5.6 MW backup UPS and switchgear for up to two 3.25 MW generators, so it's safe to say it draws at least one megawatt at least some of the time. If it continually drew one megawatt for one year, it would consume 30 TJ, which coincidentally is half the yield of the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. At 5 MW, about two and a half of those bombs. So a lot of energy, but still a fraction of a percent of a typical power plant's output.",2022-08-26T05:28:07Z,0,

Using this sort of method, you wouldn‚Äôt need to use the electricity grid 24/7 rather only when a barge is going through the floodgates and before a barge leaves the set of flood gates and both gates are sealed, you could send a lethal amount of electricity or some other lethal substance to fish into the water the barge is in which would prevent any normal migrating fish from making it into the lake.

Jacob Black,"I believe the greatest form of love is shone to us by sacrifice. What we are willing to give up for the love of someone else.
Too often and too frequently is life filled with bitterness, anger, hatred, and jealousy. Just imagine what kind of world it would be
if we all loved one another, if we all cared, and had concern for each other. That we all did our best to make sure life was good for everyone. 
That no one was homeless, that no one faced despair, neglect, cruelty or starvation.
That there were no more wars, wars built on greed, and man's fear of each other, fear of the unknown.
I think of the ultimate sacrifice when a carpenter named Jesus Christ from Bethlehem faced beatings, whippings, insults, injury, and crucifixion
for our sins. who died so we could become righteous, to never again face the fear of death or the nightmares of hell ever again.
a righteousness we could never earn unto ourselves, not based on our performance, but given to us as a gift of mercy. None of us are righteous, perfect or good (any human who claims that is untruthful with you) 
we have all sinned before God. Everyday we make mistakes
and everyday we sin in word, thought, action and deed, but God loved us so much that he look past our frail human nature and our failures and loved us and wanted to save us anyway despite
 the fact we could never be good or righteous on our own merit. 
Call unto the Lord Jesus Christ, forsake
your sins, believing with all your heart that he is the God who created heaven and earth, and he will gladly forgive you and welcome you unto the family of God forever.
''For God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, that everyone who believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal life''
John 3:16 

""This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.

For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy,

Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,

Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God;

Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.

For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers lusts,

Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth""

Am√©lie Gonissen,It‚Äôs said in the video that the carps were initially in pools that were not connected to the river but flooding let the carps travel out of those pools and into the river. I think that having 2 canals separated by a small (or even bigger) piece of land wouldn‚Äôt cut it. A flooding could easily join your 2 canals and there goes your lake ecosystem.,2022-08-25T12:23:03Z,5,

However, knowing my dad, he joined young and - like many young men - did so because he wanted to do something good for the country. That idea is very much ingrained in American culture - even more so during the time in which he was raised (only recently have we seen such widespread and mass disillusionment with the system) - that I understand his mentality at the time. He is a good person and raised us well. While he may have a different idea of what is right and wrong, he always encouraged his children to be open-minded and tolerant. Parents like him are the reason younger generations are more willing to question our surroundings and protest what we believe to be wrong. I can‚Äôt blame individual military personnel for what is the common conception of our nation, only appreciate the progress we‚Äôve made in challenging and reconstructing that notion so younger generations don‚Äôt fall into the same traps.",2022-08-25T20:45:46Z,2,

Melanie Shields,"Someone stated that Egypt also has a problem, but their invasive fish are inedible. Carp are edible. So promoting carp as a food source and increasing fisheries harvesting these fish can also help to reduce the invasion. Large mouth bass which also live in chicago river consume juvenile carps, so increasing adult bass during times soon after hatching season for the carps, could also be helpful. Invasive snake haunt some areas when exotic pets escape and breed, so some area have snake hunts that those that kill and bring in invasive snakes get a reward per snake, this method may also be used. Using nets that catch the big carp and returning more desirable fish would be good too.",2022-08-23T14:39:39Z,1537,55

Lifecraft,"I wonder if it would be more energy-efficient to create an area of high flow. Water could be ingested downstream and then be pumped in along the canal at high speed upstream, so some of the water would pass this length of canal repeatedly, increasing overall flow rate. This would just need to be faster than these carps are able to swim. Barges could be towed through either by locomotives or a stationary towing rigg. There would be no difficulties with barges shorting out the electric impulses.",2022-08-23T11:32:00Z,8,2

Smoke,"Why don't they combine both solutions? They could set up an actual physical gate that the fish cannot get past, and then when a barge needs to get by, they electrify the water, open the gate, let the barge through, close the gate, turn off the power.

This solution has three advantages:

1) Saves resources because the gate doesn't consume energy to keep the fishes out.

2) The equipment will require less maintenance because the electric barrier will be off most of the time.

3) Safer for people and local wildlife that accidentally fall into the water.",2022-08-23T09:51:18Z,0,0

The water will have to be discharged always in the upcoming side of the river. The rest of the time the water should go through another canal that is made up of large gravel. Water will pass, but no fish will ever go through.

""Why the US Army electrifies this water"" I 100% guarantee it originally started with two soldiers on 24 hour duty getting bored out of their minds and one said wonder what would happen if we.......... Later the Army said too many people know about this. Make it look official and do it quick.

Like putting grenades in a dryer and turning on then running away.... Bored soldiers.. No. They were tactically dismantling an everyday device that had electronic parts which could have been used in making IEDs... 

I joke but when we left Iraq and the base we were on was going to be turned over we went through anything and everything that had electronics in it and had it destroyed. If it was too big to move we just took the electronics out of it. We found a few microwaves with LOTS of vent holes..

Now that I live in Wyoming and travel frequently in Montana, the Dakotas and the northern Plains/Rockies regions regularly, it's easy to see why there are concerns with boat inspections and preventing invasive species.  The carp are a great invasive species example and can cause serious injuries when traveling down a river, as you've obviously observed.

Open up a fish restaurant called Carpe Carp (sieze the carp). serve mainly those carp. design a barge like boat or boat trailer that can easily catch and store the fish as they jump from the water. 'free' fish to support your menu. lower prices due to less cost (no fish monger/market buying). help doen the population, feed people, and have a thriving business providing jobs for the local community.  if multiple places like this popped up along the rivers (spaced out) where the carp are it would help knock the population down some.",2022-08-22T23:08:15Z,1,0

That said, I'm of the opinion the canal *needs* to be closed until a safer, more reliable, and ideally, less maintenance heavy option can be found.

Here in Australia, we have a long experience with introduced carp invading our waterways, It's an absolute environmental disaster with carp at over 90% of the biomass of some of our major river systems.  Where I live was carp free for decades due to a natural barrier to fish migration, but they eventually breached it as well.  20 years on, they are in practical terms the only fish species here.

Every ship in the Navy that has any amount of electric components needs a universal ""GROUND"" that, at least for the Navy ships on the oceans, cannot be the same voltage as any specified physical location (Zero Volts) because the electrical makeup of waters abroad changes. There is a part of the ship in the center of the bottom that is designated as the ship's universal ""GROUND"" for all electronic outlets aboard. Clearly barges are not as large as a military ship and their electrical systems are probably also super minimal comparatively. However, a sustained period of time sitting still, subjected to electrical impulses seems dangerous to a ship or boat's onboard electrical system. Imagine if your established Ground was a set voltage for all onboard electrical systems and it kept getting hit with extra electrical currents.",2022-08-23T03:12:30Z,7,

Hello Tom!
If I understand your video right, there are high DC voltages running through the water! So my question is: Is there any electrolysis happening on the electrodes, any electrochemical corrosion or even a significant release of chlorine at this barriers? 
Because as far as i know the electrodes of HVDC systems in the sea in Canada emit big amounts of hydrochlorine just because of the strong currents running through the electrodes electrolytically dissolving sea water into NaOH and HCl, there are thousands of tons emitted every year around the electrodes!

I really enjoy watching your great and simple videos about ""special topics"" that nobody questions until you do!

Cammi Rosalie,"Idea: A ""Dry lock"" system.   Build a system of tightly grouped rollers in a gentle arch shape. BIG heavy-duty rollers made of solid vulcanized rubber (like forklift tires but bigger)  Whatever the biggest barge is in length, add 50% or even double to that and that's how long this roller system would be.  Dam off the canal well above flood-stage.  Install those rollers as long as specified, and as wide as the canal.  When a barge needs to pass,  it can be hooked up to a cable system within the roller bed, like a San Fransisco cable car.  The cable could then tow the barge up out of the water and along the rollers to the other side.  OR,  Similar roller system but they are powered. Like a conveyor system used in package handling facilities. The barge pulls up onto rollers in the water and the tug keeps pushing onto them until the rollers themselves can carry it all along.  At that point the tugs props are stopped and engines idled for the trip across the rollers.  Then the barge would carried over the ""dry lock"", and back down into the water.   Of course, there would need to be some give to the connections between the individual barges being transported over this contraption.  Some sort of flexible coupling, like a trailer hitch that would allow for the curvature of the roller system.   Then that all depends on the configuration of the tugs as well.  This, I don't know,  but it depends on if they can be carried over without interference to the props rudders/thrust nacelles, and if they too are mostly flat-bottomed vessels. 

Heck of a project,  but it would mitigate the risk to life and potential failure due to power outages etc.",2022-08-22T21:20:05Z,1,0

njebei,"This reminds me a little of the buffelgrass problem facing Arizona these days.  It was bought from Africa to the area in the 1970s as a drought resistant grass for cattle and for erosion control.  This grass seemed ideally suited to the area as it can go for 8 months in searing heat and rebound with a little water.  Fire can't destroy it as buffelgrass roots rebound quickly in charred soil.  No one considered how its introduction might effect other plants and animals.

Because part of buffelgrass' annual process is to become dormant and dry out, the areas where it is introduced become tinderboxes.  When fires occur, it kills the other plants in animals in the area, leaving the buffelgrass to grow even stronger the following year.  Fast forward to today and buffelgrass is everywhere.  Its introduction is now effecting Arizona's iconic saguaro cactus.  The only way to get rid of buffelgrass is to pull it up by its roots and volunteers have been going into the desert and doing just that for decades.  This has slowed the spread but unfortunately there's no way to eradicate it completely.",2022-08-22T20:39:58Z,396,8

Timo J√§hrling,"What about the following approach:
- design a gene that makes offspring infertile through mutation
- capture a certain number of carp and introduce the gene via a viral transmitter
- wait until the population dies out
One of the key factors of course is to not make the infected carp but their offspring infertile to create an artificial pandemic.
Aren't we already at a level of biological engineering that makes such an endeavor possible and maybe even financially feasible?",2022-08-22T20:22:05Z,1,4
rantingrodent416,"@Timo J√§hrling You are suggesting introducing it into the environment, you're just talking about introducing it into a small confined space in the environment (the carp's bodies) and calling it safe because we've designed things in a way where we don't even need to consider what would happen should it escape. Once it's out there you can't take it back if you were wrong about the safety factor. Viruses mutate.

Invasive species are usually introduced with this kind of logic. We're not introducing them into the environment. We're introducing them into a controlled setting that we're certain they can't escape.",2022-08-23T12:17:02Z,0,

NomadSoul76,"I suspect that degree of viral engineering is still beyond us.  What has been done some situations is to engineer a generation of animals to affect the next generation.

They have done this with mosquitoes, they engineer male mosquitoes with a gene that is fatal to female offspring and release them into the wild, they mated with females and ensure that their offspring only be male. (And males don't bite)

Apparently the gene doesn't last somehow, it only lasts for several generations.  I don't understand why but that means that this is not a long-term approach to fully eradicate mosquitoes but rather a means of limiting their population.

Maybe something similar can be done with carp, only it could be made permanent.",2022-08-23T04:36:42Z,1,

There is a reason they tell you to bring and extra set of clothes with you, and only plan on wearing something you will immediately throw in the dumpster when you get back to shore. It's really nasty. We asked the guide what happens to all the fish when we get back.

Have you considered that if the oceans continue to warm, and we continue to waste trying to play god, then our countermeasures won't stop the flooding. The flooding will cause everything to change including every fishing industry. Forget running out of fish. They will be destroyed by flood water surges. 

Wasting electricity is the last way to remedy a problem caused by wasting energy.

I believe this is called AC ;)",2022-08-22T17:27:34Z,4,2
AudioJunky,"@Nene's Apostle [8th Apostle of the Twelve] Oscillations don't need to be smooth or symmetric - if it's oscillating then it's AC, 34Hz in this case and likely resembling a square or sawtooth wave. Positive and negative sides of the AC waveform are relative to its average value - you can always draw a line through the middle of a waveform to divide the area in half on top and bottom. Earth ground is the reference in this application, and based on the description of the pulses I would guess they just pulse positive voltage 34 times a second, so the DC offset of the waveform would lie between the positive supply voltage and earth ground. Asymmetry of the waveform will change the offset value, with longer pulses providing a larger average voltage. This is how pulse-width modulation works, except that's generally done at a much higher frequency and makes use of a low-pass filter to remove high-frequency components and retain audio or other frequencies of interest, but you can also generate ""DC"" from PWM and this is how a switched-mode power supply works. This is also how some digital-to-analog converters reproduce sound from digital data, as well as how class-D power amplifiers work.",2022-08-22T19:25:16Z,0,

Turning something off doesn‚Äôt remove the electricity that is currently within a circuit (because all a switch does is prevent movement through said circuit, not magically remove all traces of energy in an instant). If we model the river as a circuit‚Äîwhich I think it‚Äôs more complex than that, then it‚Äôs easy to see that there will still be electricity there that would be enough to hurt an already weakened person (weakened because we know the lake will not turn off instantly). They‚Äôll be too weak to swim, maybe even too weak to breath regardless of the water. And on top of physics, there‚Äôs logistics. Is it easier to place a warning sign and enforce strict orders that will never have to be used, or to hire someone to guard the switch that stops the flow of electricity?

BTW, there is a way the fish could bypass the barrier.
Here in the deep south, particularly the low country, we see many borrow pits.
They were open pits dug beside roadways for fill material but rainwater filled them.
Whether by flooding or by water birds we're not certain.
But the pits often begin to contain fish.
Some think water birds, wading in one pit collect fish eggs on their feet.
They fly to another nearby pit and begin wading in it.
If just a few fish eggs are transported this way it could explain how fish appear in a 'land locked' borrow pit.
Just an idea, eh?

The impacts of 5G/60 GHz are not widely published. Here‚Äôs what we know from big telecom company promotional material: ‚Äú60 GHz has a very distinct impact on none other than oxygen itself.‚Äù Yes, articles from companies touting benefits of 5G admit 60 GHz is absorbed by oxygen as seen by this graph.

Oxygen the atom is O. Oxygen the molecule is 02. Two atoms together.

These two atoms form the oxygen molecule and share some electrons. 60 GHz causes electrons surrounding oxygen molecules to spin, akin to how high-powered microwaves running on 2.4 impact molecules in food such as water. They‚Äôre heating, in part, by impacting those molecules to rotate or oscillate with each wave. The movement energy from the rotation of these super tiny water molecules helps heat the rest of the food.

In a similar way that 2.4 causes H20 to oscillate, 5G/60 GHz even at low power causes electrons on oxygen molecules to spin, changes to the spin frequencies on oxygen electrons impact human biology.

When you breathe air into your lungs it gets oxygen into your blood, brain, tissues etc. and oxygen entering your lungs gets picked up by a very important iron containing protein called hemoglobin in your blood.

The impact of oxygen molecules spinning the electrons is that it makes the hemoglobin unable to uptake the oxygen and get it to the rest of your body.

Like, have 2 water gates, gate to outside is closed, a barge goes in, ""carp"" gate closes, then we, idk, flush this enclosed water space with some toxin, or just co2, or even zap the water like they do here, but shortly, to kill off the carp (need to control their population, after all)
Then the gate to outside opens and the barge leaves
I'm guessing that would have been too slow for the amount of barges per hour?.. But at least it would _probably_ have lower power consumption

My local ecosystem here on the Texas coast is Gulf Coast Tall Grass Prairie. There used to be 6.5 million acres of it here in Texas.

Blumoogle2,"Yup. This is the definition of an artificial darwinian selective pressure. There are carp with the genes to resist the effects of electrocution at a certain voltage just waiting to combine downstream in a way that would give some carp family tree that can reach the great lakes and its rich feeding grounds a huge breeding advantage. All they need is population pressure below the barrier to mount so that getting gradually closer to the higher current  gives a consistent advantage to some genetic line and the nice smooth gradient to voltage gives a nice smooth gradient to improve towards, which makes for a really effective rapid evolutionionary pressure.",2022-08-22T17:45:10Z,4,

Tomatohead FD,@LH Both of those are interesting explanations. But has you mentioned they fail to explain why disturbing the water would cause the behaviour.,2022-08-23T21:51:53Z,1,
LH,"@Tomatohead FD ‚Äì Here's a few answers from Googling 'why do carp jump'. Neither explain why they do it in particular response to a boat disturbing them though. Admittedly these explanations are by fishermen rather than scientists:

---

Carp, like all fish, have swim bladders. These swim bladders are a method of controlling buoyancy in the water and therefore the depth at which the carp swims.

The swim bladder is linked to the oesophagus and by varying the air within their swim bladder the fish can then rise or drop in the water column.

When carp jump out of the water and land with a fairly exciting splash, the air is forced in or out of the swim bladder through the fish‚Äôs oesophagus which then allows the fish to change depths in the water.

On shallower water, the chances of seeing fish jump are reduced quite significantly as not much pressure is built up with changes of depth, but in deeper water, you will tend to see more activity of carp leaping.

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, carp will not always jump to change swimming depths as they can do this through natural processes, if the carp leaped from the water every time they changed depth carp fishing would be even more of an interesting experience.

In lakes where carp travel from depths to the surface pressure increases on their swim bladder so jumping and forcing air from their swim bladder neutralizes this pressure so the carp can swim properly in the upper layers of the water.

---

Another reason that seems to hold its own is that carp leap out of the water to clean debris from their gills.

As you all know, or at least should, carp are mainly bottom feeders and suck up food from the water bed. Of course as the carp suck in food particles of dirt and debris can also be taken in and build up in their gills.

So why not clean this debris with a leap out of the water? When the carp hit the water rushes through their gills washing out any built-up silt or mud.

In silty lakes, carp will rummage through the lake bed looking for food, so once again build-ups of silt occur in their gills, so a jump from the water cleans them out.

Carp tend to find themselves bothered by parasites, so it is commonly thought that carp jump from the water as a way of ridding themselves from these parasites.

The force of the carp hitting the water is a method of scrubbing parasites from their bodies.

Googie Gress,"@Parity Bit It's true that it's difficult to ""fish out"" a river. In the PNW, rivers still have some salmon, even though disastrous fishing activity a long time ago devastated the salmon runs. 

I'm not talking about a subsidy. A tax break reduces a company's tax burden, helping to make it more profitable. You wouldn't put out a bounty on carp! If the math on that is lean enough to make it possible but not enough to encourage cheating, I think it could be workable. Perhaps by offering the top-down benefits based not on catch but on third-party survey of fish population in the river. If the population isn't going down, there's no public benefit, so there's no incentive paid. Again, working with one company in a limited area like a river is logistically different from trying to survey rat population in an entire city and dealing with hundreds of individual rat-catchers. 

That said, you've pointed out an excellent case where private enterprise is an inappropriate approach to a problem because of the profit motive, and it may be more effective for the government to run the fishery with the intent to destroy fish and offset the costs by selling the waste material.",2022-08-23T07:01:13Z,0,

Patrick Okan,"Yes. It's literally happened (on a small scale) many, many times over. I live in Minnesota, the ""land of 10,000 lakes."" There are more registered boats in the state of Minnesota than in all but a small handful of other states. The boats are routinely moved from lake to lake, often in completely separated or isolated watersheds or drainage basins. Many boats include ballast tanks or live wells which can harbor fish, and the boats themselves can harbor other species of plants or animals which can stow away on the hull or elsewhere until the boat is dropped into another body of water. These species can then gain access to a water body that previously didn't contain them, can then sometimes establish a breeding population, and go on to devastate the lake's or the watershed's native or pre-existing ecology. In a state like Minnesota, where the lakes form a significant part of the state's economy and way-of-life for many, the introduction of even one invasive species into an area can be devastating. Sometimes the catalyst for this is just a single instance of someone accidentally carrying organisms from an ""infested"" to an ""uninfested"" body on some unseen part of their boat or in a water reservoir. It's a serious problem that local, county, and state governments have spent considerable amounts of money to address.",2022-08-22T15:58:39Z,28,

Gaming While Broken,"@Fayt Albel 

You are straight up the problem that conservational biologists have been discussing over the past ten years or so. Your obsession with non-native organisms is drawing attention (and thus resources) away from other more pressing issues. The carp‚Äôs impact is localized the mountain pine beetles isn‚Äôt. You realize that right? They are destroying huge swaths of forests and they cause deadfall. That‚Äôs bad, deforestation is a huge contributor to climate change (which could easily be one of the most destructive effects on the environment) and deadfall causes forest fires‚Ä¶ both of those leads to huge emissions of CO2. In the last 20 years they are responsible for nearly a 1000 megatons of CO2 emissions.

That‚Äôs almost 1.5X Canada‚Äôs annual CO2 emissions. Considering those numbers are already included in Canadas emission it‚Äôs likely that up to 5% of Canada‚Äôs carbon emissions is that one species of beetle. The fact you think the carp is worse because it‚Äôs introduced is crazy‚Ä¶ the beetle has a way worse impact and both are equally our fault. That‚Äôs the point of my argument, that we should shift out focus from introduced species and instead focus on problematic species. Will a lot of problematic species be introduced species? Yes, in fact the large majority of them will be (though that percentage will almost certainly lower as climate change ramps up).",2022-08-26T14:40:20Z,0,
Fayt Albel,@Gaming While Broken there is still a big difference between something you even admitted is native to NA which this beetle is so that's irrelevant and something not even native to the continent introduced by Humans. End of the day these carp are a bad example they can't tolerate salt water. There is 100% no way they get here without help from Humans so quit trying to reinforce you fallacy by saying well this beetle native to NA did the same thing. As this is not natural.,2022-08-25T20:24:15Z,0,
Gaming While Broken,"@Fayt Albel 

Did you read what I said? Organism colonizing new territory is normal. Yes, sometimes an organism will use another organism to accomplish that task. What you described is natural, it happened before us and it‚Äôll happen after we are gone. For example, Lemurs didn‚Äôt evolve in Madagascar they colonized it (and then diversified). The Fossa in Madagascar also did not originate there and colonized Madagascar. Both of those events dramatically shifted the ecosystems of Madagascar. Bats colonized New Zealand. Large Cats (and other non-marsupial mammals colonized South America. That event destroyed several families of organisms. Like the flightless birds of SA are gone because of it. 

Furthermore, there is a push in conservation biology and ecology to stop calling non-native organisms as invasive, alien, or other derogatory terms. Instead we should call certain species problematic species (specifically ones that cause ecological imbalance that negatively affects us). One reason is that invasive species gives people the impression that this isn‚Äôt a normal phenomenon, it is. There also the fact that native species can become problematic due to climate change. Iirc, there is a species of beetle that is wreaking havoc in British Columbia and it is a native species. The reason why is that they now get an extra reproductive cycle due to the warmer climate. Speaking of climate change, it is likely that organisms will move and colonize new territory at an incredibly fast rate. There are even talks about whether we should assist that happening or not.",2022-08-25T18:43:59Z,0,

Again, ""the sewer system will need to be redone"" is possibly another one because, suppose Chicago dumps its sewer untreated into a river, the same logic seems to be applicable to defending that practice too.

""Schafer Fisheries has been selling carp since 2006 out of a small river town in northern Illinois, and reports sales of 10 to 15 million pounds per year‚Äîmost of which is shipped to China. Two Rivers Fisheries, based out of Wickliffe, Kentucky, will sell more than 3 million pounds this year, according to operations manager Jeff Smith. Next year, Smith is forecasting sales of 8 million pounds. 
...
Smith noted the high cost of those shipments‚Äîoften 25 cents per pound. But selling domestically is difficult, too, he said. ‚ÄúThe problem with the American market is they do not want to deal with getting the bones out of it.‚Äù""",2022-08-22T16:33:57Z,46,
