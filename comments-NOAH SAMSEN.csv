Focused Fighter,"@divarly asmr I think people on a date should pay for their onw stuff; because you still don't know if the other person is just using you or if it'll work out.
Some of us have brains and went this way even without being told, and I'm not the only woman like this who paid a lot of stuff to the guys I ended up respecting.
Somehow we never get mentioned anywhere: and 90% of guys still think that the stereotype 'women go for yo moneh' applies to all women: in my circle of family/friends, I don't even know a woman who behaves this way.
Yet, this stereotype just WON'T F die......
It's not like men to whom we give gifts to, and buy stuff for, go around the net to spread the word. They don,t. So the world only hears about bad women.
But to constantly think that only men give, only men get played, etc: is just blind BS.....!!!
You don't know me, you don't know I had to refuse money from men just because they think we're all the same: then THEY dare act offended when I refuse their filthy cash!
How about I can be offended for taking me for this type of person? I swear, MEN!

NA,"‚ÄúMost women do not want to deal with male pain if it interferes with the satisfaction of female desire‚Äù - yeah everyone who supports the red pill agrees with you? There‚Äôs a reason women have such distain for these men‚Ä¶ because it‚Äôs not attractive. Why? Emotional men are reckless. Women perceive them as dangerous and not in a ‚Äúbad boy‚Äù kind of good way as in he can‚Äôt control his emotions he might hurt me kind of way. Men who allow their emotions to dictate their actions are a complete disaster. An unreactive man is a good man.

Why do certain men abuse their women or kids? Because they are unable to control their emotions

Why do certain men rape? Because they are unable to control their desires. 

Why do certain men feel the need to kick the shit out of each other? Because they are unable to control their anger. 

Telling men to express their emotions is a very bad message. A good man is a stoic man. He does not allow how he feels to dictate his actions. He is in control of his mind is mind is not in control of him. You shouldn‚Äôt talk about your emotions with a women if you want her to stick around. Women are simply not attracted to weak men who are not in control of their own life because weak men who aren‚Äôt in control are dangerous.",2022-09-12T09:11:14Z,0,0

XXX HARAMBAE,"it soo funny to see everyone glance over the actual positions and merits of the rp philosophy and completely disregard the reason people are drawn to it in the first place. in this community what is idealized is the nuclear family and a marriage with a young woman (who is able to create a large family) while that marriage lasts a lifetime. if one is going to happen at all. these men idealize and want to become the gentil patriarch or heroic artisan. are also probably religious, conservatives and capitalist's 
if you want to make a video about dissecting rp or manosphere, go over the people like Rollo Tammassi, Patrice O'Neil, Alexander Grace, Tom Leykis. 


some simple truths, 

-dating for most men is trash especially in the modern age.(I.e.: demanding traditional male role while not fufilling the traditionally female role)

-social media expands dating pools exponentially. in the past everyone would be out and about not glued to their phone giving more opportunities to the average man. men's sexual thirst for women on the net is mostly at fault here. why date one average guy when you could have 1000's of simps paying 5$ a month to see ur puss puss.

-average man by modern standards cant support a family let alone a woman's ever-growing expectations. (5'7-5'8'''',42k/yr, 39 waist)(one of the most common statements is that women prefer men who make 1.5x what they do minimum, disregarding the ones who say 100k+ only or 250k or other dumb shit) housing prices are also so high that in most cities 50k a year wont qualify you to purchase a house. something essential for building wealth and establishing a family. they say women want it all, but most men would be satisfied being ""happy""

-divorce is initiated by women 70-80% of the time and even more if college educated.

-women wait to meet winners at the finish line. ever since school age the men who where most desired had things, wealth, or looks. while the rest got as close to 0 attention as humanly possible. once we achieve and grow we eventually become a preferred choice, after being disrespected for decades. then you expect us to accept children out of wedlock and want guys to pay for all your kids MacDonald's.

-the system is designed to be played by a 2 person team, and there are hardly any ""teammates"" available. if 2 people made 80-100k and were willing to move to a less desirable place, a family unit could easily be established. theres still 50-100k houses for sale in America.

-women don't do their part in reducing costs of building a family and instead want to compete for the breadwinner position and in doing so only increase the expenses a family must put out to cover a 2 working person house hold.(the whole point of a breadwinner/horseperson is to make the breadwinner able to work more because one simply cannot work 60-80hrs and do home stuff, and home stuff like cooking, diy improvements, childcare/management, housework are all significant causes for expense that can be mitigated through one person dedicating themselves to reducing those costs. (ex i could go to a restaurant and spend 50$ on one meal but that same 50$ in the grocery store could feed a family of four for 1-2 meals, same with child care its likely going to cost 60-80% of a persons wage to cover child care without government funding.)most household tasks can be done simultaneously giving more personal time than would be possible in the jobs most breadwinners would take. one of the most common complaints on this subject is that homemaking doesn't pay... yes and no. yes because it doesn't pay you with a check every 2 week. but if you took his last name 50% of the equity is yours no matter what. while childrearing also provides you with a guaranteed income post marriage if you decide to leave for any reason valid or not. competition for the breadwinner position also increases the workforce which in turn stagnates and reduces wages due to supply and demand.

-women's financial support has a time limit. while men are expected to finically support their partner and family for the rest of their life. weather they divorce or not. alimony/ child support which is almost always awarded to women through the unjust family courts.

-everyone says ""till death do you part."" but wont follow through with the decision and contract they brought into existence of their own free will. were all adults here, nobody was tricked or forced. even in arranged marriages the women and their families have the power to decide weather to follow through or not

-1:5 men men who have paternity tested children find out they are taking care of kids who their wife made them believe was their biological child and is not. women do not usually face charges for this type of fraud.

-family courts favor women tremendously

-men in need are under supported and left to rot, hardly any men's shelters or safe spaces for men.

-women regularly have random sexual escapades with many guys in their young years demand almost nothing of them. then wait till the eggs are almost dried up to find the supportive family building type of guy. then have a long list of demands for him to meet and deal with because of the trauma she obtained in her younger years all while the supportive family type of guy was toiling away working and learning how to make a larger than average amount of income. probably at the detriment of his sex life.",2022-09-03T13:51:01Z,0,0

Deon,"This is only my second clip of Noah so I might need to see more to have a better conclusion. But so far I feel you have the best intentions of wanting to shed light on the problems the manosphere seems to have especially the relationship misconceptions with women. I applaud you for the effort. I've watched red pill content but always with a grain of salt as I could never agree with everything they say or their approach to relationships. They do however bring up some of the double standards and unfair expectations society has for men to which I can confirm from my own experience. That being said looking through the comments it seems despite your best efforts to bring a healthy light on some of their problematic issues the praise of your positive intent is a bit overshadowed by the glee of bashing the subjects of your analysis. Not your fault at all but the comments very much resemble the comments on some of the redpill content creators i've watched. Youtube is full of echo chambers so this isn't surprising but folks that watch seem to have their hate of the content creators validated and then basically high five each other and go ""yeah they suck"" collectively. Its all just the same stuff. A group state their beliefs and ridicules those that don't share their beliefs then another groups responds and ridicules them back and vice versa. I still will watch more of your content cause you're funny and have good critique. Just don't know if your audience will lean more pro positivity or more collective bashing; not that yt has any shortage.",2022-07-13T21:45:57Z,0,0

She literally said they have been dating for a while and that he NEEDS to pay everytime.... And he also DID say men weren't raised right if they don't offer either..... He said that REGARDLESS of gender or sexuality you should OFFER to pay. It should be a mutual thing and you should never EXPECT someone to pay for you....

Bruh you literally clipped out most of the question and answer to make a point..... 

Now there's people in the comments thinking he was genuinely advocating for women to just sleep with men if they pay which he wasn't ....

Avery McKenna,"I find the mentality of being controlling towards your partner as a means to combat the potential they might cheat to be super, extra insane in a way a lot of people don't often point out. If your SO would cheat on you, if given the opportunity, then your relationship is already deeply toxic and damaged. It's a relationship that you should be able to acknowledge isn't working; it's a relationship that you shouldn't *want* to continue. You should always feel comfortable with trusting your partner around others and if you don't you should consider deeply why you feel that way.",2022-06-29T10:53:19Z,1,0

Four Lights Orchestra,"@Bearded Bear Yeah, I worded that horribly, I meant from a time where women made drastically (even more than now) less than men. I realize the pay gap is still a thing, but I mean it's a different world now where it's not an uncommon thing for a woman to work a full time job, as I'm not sure how common that was prior to the 1930's. That's a theme I see come up in pre code Hollywood movies, that a woman being independent and working was a relatively new way to live.",2022-07-01T08:55:30Z,1,
Bearded Bear,"Well, you're mostly right. Men however still make more. The gender pay gap was and still is a real thing. However, the further back you go the more difficult it was for a woman to be financially independent. As recently as 1950's America for instance, women were often refused their own bank account. 

Either they were expected to have one gifted to them by a parent, usually the father, or expected to use their husband's. This wasn't universally true of course, but it was common enough that it gave rise to a whole pile of stereotypes and ""gender norms"" that persist to this day.",2022-07-01T06:15:33Z,2,

HOWEVER i think its way better being honest with yourself and having a serious discussion with one self and make up your mind on certain topics and not be group pressured into believing something one does not believe in (of course that also comes with not hating on people who believes the opposite u do)... i dont want a chick that sleept with anyone cuz im a vrigin and so i expect my gf to be aswell im not gonna change that standard for literally.... besides dont give me the crap about not being sexually compatible... i think i comes down to both parties being honest again and a clear communication. 

i just think its honestly sad too see u make fun of everything however shows me no personality wheres your thoughts on this and that... got none? i mean u cant be serious for even a second its really sad.. too afraid of upsetting ur fan base or what? like come one man grow a pair and say something u agree with the opposite instead of always disagreeing it makes no sense cuz it seems like u believe in either black or white and that conecpt exludes the grey parts in the world that exists... i honestly get triggered when people like u dont even try to have a serious discussion just gaslighting and strawmaning every agrument someone puts on the table.... this worlds sucks ass but mostly the women do",2022-06-26T16:11:22Z,1,4

Jacky,"There's like...a massive issue in the biology community I think that unfortunately helps play into this way of thinking. Animal behaviorists often liken how animals choose mates to how humans go about dating, and they try way too hard to explain away all human dating behaviors as biologically inherent. While some of them certainly are (like dressing nicely for a date), there's a lot that aren't and are just a product of how the society we've built is structured. Those can't really be explained with biology but a lot of biologists do their hardest to try.  

So when biologists are out here saying, oh, women will go after men who are older and have more money because they need a male to provide for them, because biology, redpill guys will absolutely eat that up. It's a viewpoint that is really centered around how men feel in a patriarchal society and fails to capture any nuance in human dating or the reality of human lifestyles. Men aren't the only ones who put on a show for a potential partner's attention--women do that too. Men aren't the only providers to a family--women do that too.

It's just annoying, how even biologists subscribe to this idea that a patriarchy exists for a reason, and actively push for massively bioessentialist views on human behavior. People might argue against this and say, well, something being biologically based doesn't necessarily mean it's okay, and it's just a simple fact. And, yeah, but think about what you are arguing for there. That women are biologically just submissive and meek and peaceful, and men are dominant and loud and violent, and that's the truth? That helps nobody and is transphobic and misogynistic. But because it's ""biology"" people take it as fact and use as an excuse for shitty men's behavior, and it just gives incels/alpha male types more ammunition.",2022-06-20T16:45:46Z,6,0

I got a cousin who is extremely successful with women and its not because he has some great pick up lines or some great ladies man with amazing movie star charisma. He literally plays the odds he approachs so many women some of them are bound to yes. His secret is it doesn hurt his ego getting turned down. That burning/embarrassment feeling you feel when you get shot down this nigga is immune to it. He gets shot down like everyone else he just doesnt let it affect him emotionally. So the next time he sees a girl he wants he just speaks starts a conversation like normal person doesnt trea hert like a precious Goddess whos approval he needs to win. Of course treat women with respect but stop being afraid to look stupid.  Stop needing their approval. They shit, piss, burp and fart the same way you do. You are their equal not inferior. 

stop chasing girls
-get healthy
-get your money up
-Stop being bitter about women
-Learn to control Your emotions
-most important get a better relationship with God

Get these together and You'll find the right one

That way it stays pretty even throughout the relationship and eventually paying for the date will be seen as a romantic gesture.

Don‚Äôt remember his name though. I also just realized I have the same wolf poster that the Tom and jerry guy has in the background. Ooof for me I guess. Also I think that when your partner cannot express their emotions it just makes you feel guilty for expressing your emotions. Anyone who has any emotional maturity knows this. I do feel bad for men that they have to be ‚Äòstrong‚Äô all the time when that is impossible. You have to have someone to lean on from time to time. And that absolutely needs to be normalized, like yesterday. And oh boy they brought up the whole, ‚Äòwomen can fool around when they‚Äôre young but not as they age‚Äô bs. These guys actually think that they get bette with age. From where? It‚Äôs like they don‚Äôt listen to women, oh that‚Äôs right they don‚Äôt. Also if the person I‚Äôm out with is more concerned about who is paying for the date than actually getting to know each other then I‚Äôm not going on a second date. I think coming to the realization that heteronormative people are obsessed with this made me 100% for just going Dutch.

Lochan,"""And I saw the dead,¬†small and great, standing before¬†God,¬†and books were opened. And another¬†book was opened, which is¬†the Book¬†of Life. 
And the dead were judged¬†according to their works, by the things which were written in the books.
The sea gave up the dead who were in it,¬†and Death and Hades delivered up the dead who were in them.¬†And they were judged, each one according to his works.¬†
Then¬†Death and Hades were cast into the lake of fire.¬†This is the second¬†death.¬†And anyone not found written in the Book of Life¬†was cast into the lake of fire."" (REVELATION 20:12-15 NKJV)


Today, while you are still alive and able, may you repent from your sins, believe in your heart and confess with your mouth that JESUS CHRIST is your Lord and Savior, so that through Him, your name will be written in the Book of Life. 


""For¬†God¬†so¬†loved¬†the¬†world¬†that¬†He¬†gave¬†His¬†only¬†begotten¬†Son,¬†that¬†whoever¬†believes¬†in¬†Him¬†
should not¬†perish¬†but¬†have¬†everlasting¬†life.

Ephesians 5: 28 - ""In the same way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies.""
It also talks about how the man is the ""head"" of the woman, but in the same way that Jesus is the head/lead of his congregation. He's a leader and protector, not a controller. It's not a dictatorship. Also, men, BE someone who is WORTH ""submitting to."" Be someone she can trust and rely on. Know how to do your own laundry üôÑ
I know for a fact that if I end up falling for some great guy, there's going to be times where I'll let him do what he wants with me, BUT !!! that is ONLY BECAUSE we'd agree to that, I'm in the mood for it/up for it, and I LOVE HIM SO MUCH that it would be good for me anyway. And we'd have a safe word/code/tap-out, and he'd stop if I end up wanting to. Marital rape is a thing.
Also for goodness' sake! How insecure are you that I can't be with guy friends? I've personally always had either equal amounts of boy/girl friends or MORE guy friends than girl friends. I'm not going to stop being friends with people I've known longer than you just bc you need therapy lol


The whole section:
""22  Let wives be in subjection to their husbands as to the Lord, 23  because a husband is head of his wife just as the Christ is head of the congregation, he being a savior of this body. 24  In fact, as the congregation is in subjection to the Christ, wives should also be to their husbands in everything. 25  Husbands, continue loving your wives, just as the Christ also loved the congregation and gave himself up for it, 26  in order that he might sanctify it, cleansing it with the bath of water by means of the word, 27  so that he might present the congregation to himself in its splendor, without a spot or a wrinkle or any of such things, but holy and without blemish. 28  In the same way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. A man who loves his wife loves himself, 29  for no man ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cherishes it, just as the Christ does the congregation, 30  because we are members of his body. 31  ‚ÄúFor this reason a man will leave his father and his mother and he will stick to his wife, and the two will be one flesh.‚Äù",2022-06-16T18:26:00Z,0,0

Nyshyn,"11:30 I would disagree that the counter-content is specific for one major reason: there are no real alternative communities offered. That's important because a lot of men fall into Redpill communities since it's one they feel prioritized in. Of course a lot of bad advice is tossed around but the lonely audience these guys appeal to isn't going to be swayed by ""just treat women well"", ""most women aren't like this"", ""this is a result of the patriarchy that you should be working to dismantle"",  or ""stop focusing so much on relationships"" because many of them feel such thinkings already haven't gotten them anywhere. They essentially view videos like those as whataboutism because the people making them don't prioritize tangible steps and solutions to men's issues as opposed to telling them why the redpill is toxic. It's of course important to say why redpillers and their beliefs are toxic but until these kinds of videos prioritize alternative solutions and communities where men are prioritized, I think they'll remain unconvinced",2022-06-16T15:10:01Z,0,1

Sara Lee,"The argument is women can sleep with who they wish to has overt flaws, some quantifiable and the others quantifiable. If I may sleep with whomever I wish, then that man is also sleeping with who he wishes to sleep with, unless the argument is that men are constantly assaulted by women who force them into sex. Sex requires two people. Everyone is relegated to intimacy based on access, availability and their willingness to participate. There are amazingly beautiful and kind women all over the world, however, they are still limited by their access to and the willingness of the objects of their  attractions to be mutually invested in pursuing them. What their arguments seem to be is that men have no agency. Another problem half of these videos drone on about is all of women who are ""for the streets,"" which precludes their desire to be with those women. Therefore, those women do not have access to them, per their own admission, so both cannot be true... So, women can sleep with whomever they want, just not them, but the man who she is having sex must be an unwilling participant, as only the woman is with who she wants to be with... unless you are over weight, over 26 years old, had any previous relationships, a child, or childhood male friends. Also, submission is intrinsic to compromise, something everyone does in any relationship. Both parties will submit, depending on each other's stake in the outcome.  They do not want submission, they want ownership over someone else's existence. Lastly, men do express emotion all the time. These manosphere videos are all highly emotional. You see insecurity, sadness, pain, jealousy, hurt, anger and all sorts of feelings. Even if their affect is incongruent with these emotions, the words are. You do not need to physically cry to express pain or sadness. All I see when I watch this stuff is insecurity, hurt and pain, described by people ill-equipped to manage it. Even if they had a woman to do everything they said, it wouldn't be enough, because what they are missing cannot be filled with another person. No one can make you happy, rather you share your happiness with each other, or they do not supress your ability to be happy. Meaning, individually happy people are more successful at relationships, than people who expect to be made happy through their partner's behaviours. You may be happy with your relationship, but it should not be because of it. That is too much pressure and an unfair delegation of responsibility to the other party. It is why compatibility is paramount, because you will have more things which you both find happiness in together, without having to be uncomfortable for the sake of each other's happiness. If all of the women, or men, you encounter all end the same, you're the constant. Meaning, 20 different people, from different life experiences met you, but your dissatisfaction remains the same, then the probability favours you being the catalyst for the 20 negative outcomes, not the twenty other people... or you should gamble",2022-06-16T14:43:29Z,0,0
Anna Won,"The obsession men have with ""submission"" is absolutely disgusting and disturbing. Marriage is a contract no doubt, but it isn't a slave contract! Submission is a very strong word.

At times, I believe men don't even know the true meaning of ""submission"". It just seems they want someone who worships them and does whatever they want it.

Abel Abel,"@wealth mindset Your example illustrates precisely what I was saying.

You looked at those numbers and felt that marriage is not in your best interest. This is how you *feel* about the data.

You, with your bias and the overarching narrative that sees relationships as transactions, look at the data and conclude that this happens because it is nature, or because women are interested in money, or any other similar thing. One could look at the same data and ask why those numbers are like that, like Eveliina did. Values of the patriarchy makes women care more for the children while men can focus more on careers, which is a good explanation for the numbers you see, as they mentioned. Therefore, feminism seeking to dismantle such values would be the answer for you, not the rEd PiLl. 

You could claim it is biological, of course. But then you'd have to explain why different societies have different numbers or, more importantly, radically different social structures. There are and have been societies without monogamy, with communal childcare, with matriarchal structures, etc, etc. Therefore, if said structure was biologically determined, then how would you explain these variations?",2022-06-17T07:56:33Z,3,

Eveliina Hannele,"@wealth mindset You just cherry picked those marriage statistics without explaining any of the reasons behind them and blamed women to support your redpill claims. You didn't interpret those numbers logically or rationally, you just gave numbers and said this is bad. Pure numbers don't tell anything without understanding the reasons behind it like those marriage statistics you just presented. You just cherry picked numbers without any context or explanation behind them. 

For example women are more often victims of infidelity, domestic violence and partners substance use, so ofc women are more likely to file for divorce. Unequality and pay gap are still real issues, women earn less so they get paid alimony/child support. 80% of domestic work and childcare still falls onto the shoulders of women WHILE working their day jobs, so why do you think it's a surprise court favours women more? 

These problems are all caused by the patriarchal system we live in which was created by certain group of men and as such the system heavily favours those men. It's not women's job to fix the system and women certainly aren't the ones keeping these structures alive.",2022-06-16T15:54:49Z,4,
wealth mindset,"@Abel Abel There is no cherry picking done because there is no ‚Äúoverarching narrative‚Äù to the red pill. Only information one chooses to discuss. 

Secondly how you ‚Äúfeel‚Äù about the information is only relevant when you intend to interpret the information emotionally. when the information (even raw data assuming the study isn‚Äôt biased) is interpreted logically and rationally, simple conclusions and best practices can be drawn. For example if you look at marriage statistics in America; 50% of marriages end in divorce, 80% of divorces are filed by women, 90% of alimony/child support is paid by men to women, and men lose child custody 90% of the time. Now, knowing this information any logical and rational person (particularly males since they suffer the most from divorce) can look at this data and logically conclude that marriage in America is not in his best interest. That‚Äôs just one example. Plenty of other examples out there.",2022-06-16T15:02:06Z,0,
Abel Abel,"@wealth mindset Cherry-picked means that ""information"" contradicting the overarching narrative of ""red pill"" will be disregarded. You could simply look up the meaning of ""cherry-picking"".

How one ""feels"" about the ""information"" is quite important, especially on soft science fields (like psychology, sociology and economics), since one can easily jump to conclusions and to overarching narratives based own their on biases - whether they want it or not. Raw data means little without analyzing the shortcomings of experiments or, more importantly, the establishment of causation.

There is no information without one interpreting and writing it. Humans will always be involved, especially when studying, erm, humans.

There's sooooo much tragic, disgusting, horrible things MANY,not all but tons of  women have done and the similarities, common occurrences, same exact things, that many women have done to men and some of us are aware now. Look at Tik Tok idiot girls straight up saying the grimy stuff they do. The entitlement. I guarantee you the majority of women on here agree with this mislead guy only because they're women. No responsibility for what many women have done. Ya'all are just against any man that states the horrible things many women do and how they operate in the total. RED Pill is to help men be careful. It's to educate. It's I don't know prevent suicides. Most suicides are from men. But you can pretend you didn't just read that and pretend you can't look up that statistic. Majority, not all of women today are demonstrating these detestable ways of thinking and acting. Its extremely nervy of you to belittle men for wanting to be safe. Not lose all their money because courts always side with the women. It's pathetic how you and these followers COMPLETELY don't care for the guys trying to be safe and educated. You care about women? What about the guy who was cheated on and the girl had a kid with the other guy and the courts made him pay for the kid of the other guy? Yall missing tons of information. Now, if there are guys who are going with red pill just to get laid or they're knowingly with a toxic girl and are trying to navigate by learning red pill, that I disagree with. Those types of red pill guys are douschbags. I'm speaking for what I said prior. Oh by the way, so you're saying men should automatically pay for the meal? Women like that are self entitled and take a nice gesture for granted. If I go on a date, I don't want it automatically assumed I'm paying for her. Is she my daughter? Treat her like a kid? What about how women can make money themselves? I think if they're independent, it's actually offensive to assume the guy will pay. Hmmm. I'm not saying all men are good either. But you people on here are missing too much. But some red pill guys have a lot of wisdom and can help, but some of them aren't discouraging to stay away from bad women. That with some of the red pill is pathetic. BTW, to anyone that thinks I'm just a bitter guy who mistreated my girl and now I'm saying all this. NOPE. I don't have to. Social media showed all this. Many women have demonstrated this. It out. Also the girls on this channel just hate the fact that there's women that misrepresent you, so you'll just target men who call you out on it. Instead of thinking "" Maybe those guys are right. Not about me though"" that's all. But thar requires a tad of humility which obviously a lot of you girls lost or don't have because your ex banged a better looking girl.

Jamie Woodward,"So now u keep coming up on my feed because I watched Isaac do a response on your response of him.

I am only 2 minutes into your video so I probably should watch more before I write something but I'm really sick  atm so I probably won't watch much more of this video.

So Todd, I want to know why it's cool to speak poorly about males u don't knoah anything about except a short video clip of (yes that was a lame joke but probably better than Todd's) when Isaac speaks out about people eating themselves to death that is a good cause.

Body positivity is good for people that can't change what they are stuck born with, not for people that are purposely giving themselves heart attacks and diabetes just like in reverse, being anorexic is also very bad.

I think it's because your either two things. 

It's because when Isaac spoke on woman, your possibly so far left that u have came around to the right side without even realizing it or..

U think u will get viewers, money possibly puss (if that's what your even into) for following the P.C culture.

I think this is the 2nd or 3rd video I have seen of u and all I can say is P.C is bad for business, then knoah one will want to watch but good luck with your channel and if u want to try and change the world, u need to speak on there level and let them decide for themselves to change.

In my opinon i don't really think u do want to change the world for the best, I think u just want money or clout and I do hope if u make it that u don't find yourself lonely at the top because that's where alot of people find themself when they reach that spot. 

People may need to watch Isaac butterfield to understand what Im talking about and why I'm calling him Todd.",2022-06-15T12:14:33Z,2,4

I was once very under weight and got alot of judgment over it, I won't go to deep into it but it made me workout and over eat to not be seen in that light. 

By about a year after I became over weight for my height. I thought I was only having anxiety but when I finally went to the doctors, they informed me that I was having angina attacks that were turning into mini heart attacks.

I was very lucky to get this information in time so I could change my eating habits.

After about another 12 months this had changed me for the best, I felt great and now am able to spend more time with my children without having a heart attack and dying on them.

It's a great message and just because I want to eat crappy foods shouldn't fall on the out come of my loved ones.

When women share these views, isn't that often because the societal standards influence them just as much as men? Besides, it's not even true that women are allowed to express themselves more freely anyway, so often we are derided and belittled for being ""emotional"" and are dismissed because of it.",2022-06-15T11:59:10Z,1,0

Natalia Sanchez,"@Markov Chain Hey that‚Äôs fantastic! üòäGood for you! Then now let me address something because I can see were I might come off as very optimistic in my post but Ima be real with you watching the state of discord in our country has made me extremely pessimistic honestly. Not only as a women who is seeing her rights to healthcare being challenged but also as a Puertorican seeing the supreme court punished someone who lived most of their life in America, for moving back to Puerto Rico. Its hard to read and its even harder to read people talking to each other on the internet because they literally are providing the material necessary to further alienate a whole group of people. The way people communicate is so unempathetic it hurts but thats why the divide only gets bigger. I‚Äôve said my fair share of things because I was letting emotions put my foot in my mouth BUT I‚Äôm also one to take steps back when I can tell I might have invalidated someone or if I didn‚Äôt have enough knowledge to continue. Like you I am also someone who like to read everything I can get my hands on so whenever I‚Äôm stuck I go read and learn more. Anyway let me address the point you said that everyone isn‚Äôt like me and yeah I know BUT again it doesn‚Äôt hurt to speak up and ask for clarification and if they still double down in a rude way then you just walk away cause why talk to someone not willing to apologize for invalidating you. You can set communication boundaries. I think all of us would benefit from being more open in dialogue. Also even if someone said it in a negative way ya might as well go damn thats some good advice if thats the only nice thing you have to say than I will be going now. Basically what I am trying to say in a long winded way is that we need more people to actively put themselves in other people‚Äôs shoes regardless of right or wrong. But as the state of discord in our Country has shown not many people are which fucking sucks üòÆ‚Äçüí®  Learning to communicate takes time but I am working on it everyday in hope that one day I can have more open conversations with people. Honestly I just want people to stop fearing what they don‚Äôt understand and to mind their business if it doesn‚Äôt affect them. As for your finally tid bit thanks for what you said I appreciate it as you can see I‚Äôm very passionate about these topics. Oh as for post graduation depression I literally got so sick after undergrad due to built up repressed PTSD symptoms that I was out of commission for 2 years and am now in grad school so haha I felt that too deeply. Anyways I‚Äôll just say hopefully some day more people will learn that dehumanizing someone just because they are in the wrong won‚Äôt get you anywhere because they don‚Äôt think they are and IT WILL LITERALLY GET YOU NOWHERE like omygosh is so hard to read and watch makes me want to beat my head against the wall üò© I‚Äôm honestly impressed by how bad people are at communicating",2022-07-01T23:20:42Z,0,

The fact that you think that me saying that is invalidating your feeling and calling you pathetic shows me your opinion on therapy. I think its a powerful thing to go to Therapy it takes a lot to actively work on yourself. Sometimes you alone is not enough and thats okay. I just want you to know that there are people out there who say statements like go to therapy because they genuinely want you to heal and work through what hurts you. I won‚Äôt lie to you that there are many communication barriers in society today and it sucks but I have some advice for you. If someone says this to you and you think they might be invalidating you, say that to them and ask them to clarify to you if that is not their intent. Therapy is an amazing resource especially when you find the right therapist for you (which might take time but who said working on yourself is easy). I just want you to know too that your feelings are valid and therefore you should be open to expressing them in order to understand the intent of a person. I get taught this a bunch in school about the importance of separating intent vs. Impact because you might not intend to cause harm when you say something but that doesn‚Äôt take away from the fact that the things you said hurt someone else. I can talk about the problems with communication for hours but yeah I just felt like saying my piece. I hope one day therapy can help you as much as it has helped me which is why I went on this rant.

I do have friends and hobbies. Why did you assume I didn't? You're assuming a lot about me here and I don't really understand why? It feels like you're trying to put me in an easy-to-define box like I'm a 'nice guy' or something similar when I'm literally just a regular dude expressing myself 

I'm also similar in that I'm often exhausted and don't have the energy to go out and socialise sometimes, so I understand that struggle

What you said about being hypervigilant around men due to bad past experiences is exactly what I was talking about, women often have their guard up around men, and that's true even for talking to them as friends.

hotarubinariko,"@Pain Unending ""Be cooperative and give you a chance."" Something about that right there would raise a red flag for me. The other thing is meeting people as an adult and having time to put into them is really freaking hard, I don't know about you but I work 40+ hours a week and basically have no savings after rent, bills and groceries. I'm exhausted all the time and the way the world is right now makes me so uncomfortable I barely want to go out, especially where there's a lot of people. It's probably not that they're ""not coopertating"" but more of their time a seriously limited and their energy possibly nonexistent, so it's hard to build those relationships. You need to get a hobby and make friends. Friends will mean healthier more fulfilling relationships and it will open doors for potential romantic ones. But if you're going into every friendship with a woman with the end goal of sex or even a serious relationship, that will make it harder for you to really let your guard down and get to know her. Us women are always frightened by men because of our past experiences, we are hypervigilant and will notice if your motives are off. Just literally be yourself, treat her like you would one of the ""boys"" or any person you spend time with and things will go better. These things take time. If you want an overnight wife, try mail-order brides, because life doesn't work like that, unfortunately. My partner was on my periphery for a long time before we got together and it took a while for me to let my guard down but he was honestly the same, now we have one of the best relationships I could have imagined or have ever come across. And frankly, I was rejected by a lot of men before him. I had men threaten to rape me, call me fat and ugly for not immediately taking my clothes off for them, and treat me like shit for having opinions. I thought for a long time I would never find a partner but I did. We women, we're just people. Same shit different gender.",2022-07-12T06:24:32Z,15,
Pain Unending,"@Becca Kim Most men struggle with this because it's very hard to make connections with women because they often have their guard up around men. You have to dismantle that and at the same time the woman has to WANT to make a connection back, which they often don't. In my experience it isn't me not making the time and effort but the woman

I feel like people will probably say 'if she isn't making an effort she's not the right one and you should move on' but the thing is it's woman after woman after woman who is like this.

Not Mary,"""I paid for one of your meals today so I get your body"" it just doesn't make sense. How they don't see that as a trap is beyond me, i can't think of another situation where that mindset would be ok. If it was that important it'd be discussed beforehand, but you'll also find they tend to just leave it unsaid until the bill is paid, well after the time that you can opt out gracefully.
Every girl I personally know would either split, or not let the guy pay because they feel like they're obligated to do something in return and don't want that. What's funny is that there's a lot of guys who react negatively when hearing ""split check"", and that's a BAD look. 
But among friends, it's normally the party that invites is the one that pays (and that's to avoid split check hassle, if we're offered a split we take it). This is just between my husband and I another couple we're friends with, and we've talked about how we probably have equaled out in paid bills after all these years of mutual ""i'll treat tonight"" dinners.

Or are you doing them a favour on going to the date so they sould pay you? (not talking about you but in general)
I just don't get how it's not how everyone operates. It seems so logical and basic. For example, when i asked my friends if they want to go eat to a new restaurant they don't expext me to pay for them. So i don't get they idea that someone has to pay for your meal.",2022-06-17T03:12:19Z,0,

Simple, gender-neutral, and fair. 

I would never ask a platonic friend, let alone a potential romantic partner, to join me for a movie or whatnot and then expect them to pay their own way. I wouldn't want to ask them to take on a financial burden just so that they could have the ""privilege"" of spending time with me. If I invite someone to dinner, I expect to pay the entire check. (I'm a cis woman, btw.) 

That said, I've been on dates with women who really put their foot down about going dutch, and I don't argue with that. I get it, because of the societal expectation that buying someone dinner entitles you to sex, some women are really uncomfortable with letting someone else buy their meal. (If a guy ever argued with me about paying the bill, I'd agree to go dutch with him as well...but, oddly enough, that rarely happens). But generally, if I'm the one who initiated the date, I come prepared to pay for both of us.

Ben Allmon,"@RatPfink66 Not sure but a good question for sure. My wife is a ride or die though. It might be the willingness to be better everyday and being vulnerable. I've been promoted and have helped her get promotions. We are both actively trying to grow in the same path and the same way. Constantly challenging each other to be better and to shed our toxic traits. It's something I've never found with anyone else. Not any friend or family member or previous girlfriend. 

Do I know this will last? I don't know but we are both committed to each other and trying hard to being open and honest with each other. We have had many fights and come out of them learning about ourselves and actively working on ourselves. 

Id say the one thing that kills most relationships is not being aware that you both grow as people. And without a focus on growing in the same direction, you will both become a massively different person than you were a year prior. We both want a family, both want to continue to climb in our jobs and both have the same end goals. When one of those change, we talk about it and compromise on what the best course of action is. I want to promote as much as possible while she wants to work until I can provide for the both of us, then take on a house keeper/tradition type wife role. That is her choice and I'm okay if she decides to change her mind and would be okay to be the stay at home Dad if needed. The ability to be flexible and have open communication has helped us so much. 

Tbh I just got lucky to have found her. She is a rare gem and all the years of being single and working on myself paid off in the best way possible. But even if we don't work out, it won't make me become like these red pilled weirdos. All women are not the same. Won't make me change on being vulnerable and open.",2022-09-07T22:03:08Z,1,

If you go in with unhealed wounds, it's only going to make matters worse. We take risks all the time. I don't stop taking my car just because I might get into a car crash, and god knows the chances are high. I don't stop being nice and kind just because my kindness was abused by others.

Most of the time when a woman says she wants a guy that's 'emotional/sensitive', what she really means is that she wants a guy that will validate her emotions and be sensitive to her needs/boundaries, etc. It doesn't necessarily mean she wants a guy that will cry in front of her. I've seen some of the most feminist women out there say things like ""yeah its okay if he cries but if he is more emotional than I am, then no. Like ew, man up.

Alana Montero,"There are requirements placed on women in this scenario though. Heavy requirements. Matthew Hussey teaches women to stick to the ""female"" role and to pander to a man's ego. If you are going to insist on rigid ""traditional"" gender roles, then absolutely the man should pay. It's not reasonable to expect a woman to fulfil all the aspects of the ""female"" role and for the man to have few obligations to fulfil the ""male"" role.

If you want 50/50, then have egalitarian relationships and don't expect women to be submissive and feminine and put male desires first.

Edit: Yeah, aside from women growing up in a society where this thinking has been the norm, you can't criticise women for ""not being taught right"" and not doing things equally while also reinforcing old gender roles. You can't have it both ways, Matthew. He expects women to fulfil their gender role but to treat men as if they're in an egalitarian relationship. That is incredibly imbalanced. There are also far too many men who already think like this and it should not be encouraged. Either you both follow old gender role norms (which includes the man being a provider) or neither person follows them. Otherwise, it puts even more of a burden on women than women had in the past when strict gender roles were the norm - all the work and vulnerability without the benefits.

Also, Matthew is basically equating dating to prostitution here.

Matthew Hussey sells bad dating advice to desperate women, encouraging them to bend over backwards to please a man, threatening them with being alone if they don't follow these ""rules"" because ""men won't want them"". Like so many providing bad dating advice for women. It comes with a fake dusting of ""female empowerment"" and  ""caring for and respecting women"" but underneath this superficial marketing bs his advice is quite misogynistic and awful and rather conservative. He started off as a dating coach for men then found this was more lucrative. He's also a serial cheater and all-around douchebag. No one should be getting advice from him. Sadly it appears the ""You'll be alone! You mustn't be alone! You are the reason you are single! Change this, do this and men will want you, and you'll be happy! If you don't, men won't want you! with a superficial sprinkling of pseudo-empowerment"" approach sells well.",2022-06-14T04:43:59Z,8,1

A mo,"@Jason original claim I replied to: ""No, humans do not have mating strategies like other animals. We don't do *anything* like other animals in terms of finding a mate""

My reply: We are still animals at the end of the day. *Just very unique in some senses. In other senses, not so much.*

The full introduction: Relative to those of other animals, *human mating strategies are unique in their relationship with cultural variables such as the institution of marriage* .[1] Humans may seek out individuals with the intention of forming a long-term intimate relationship, marriage, casual relationship, or friendship. The human desire for companionship is one of the strongest human drives. It is an innate feature of human nature and may be related to the sex drive. The human mating process encompasses the social and cultural processes whereby one person may meet another to assess suitability, the courtship process and the process of forming an interpersonal relationship. *Commonalities, however, can be found between humans and nonhuman animals in mating behavior, as in the case of animal sexual behavior in general and assortative mating in particular.*

To prove them wrong, I just have to show them at least *1* instance of humans and other animals showing similarities.This tells me you ignored some information to suit your own agenda. The same thing you accused me of.",2022-08-04T16:50:28Z,0,

It‚Äôs also not okay to generalize ‚Äî short men don‚Äôt ‚Äúrepel‚Äù women. It repels women who have a thing for tall guys. Yes, I understand that men can‚Äôt change their height.

Someone may not be attracted to you initially, and grow to become attracted to you over time. Someone may be attracted to you initially, and grow to dislike you over time.

SimplySnazzy,"@happyhappynuts  You do realize that beauty standards hurt everyone, not just men, don‚Äôt you? The average man has less pressure on them than women do, FYI. It‚Äôs not socially acceptable for women to be unshaven, to omit any sort of smell, to not hair their hair done, to not wear makeup. Some men claim they don‚Äôt want women who wear makeup but then call any woman who doesn‚Äôt sloppy and unattractive. 

Men don‚Äôt have to wear makeup. They don‚Äôt have to shave (unless they want to, and maybe their face sometimes). Yes, attractive men may have it easier, but this isn‚Äôt because of women inherently. Society puts pressure on men and women for different reasons. 

Also, I feel sorry for your sisters. The way you talk about then just rubs me the wrong way, tbh. Especially since you want them to be your anecdotal evidence.

Alana Montero,@A mo You seem to be confusing your feelings and subjective ideas with facts. You are being illogical and irrational and making unfounded claim after unfounded claim. Using a bunch of sciency sounding words does not make something scientific or even factual.,2022-06-22T06:49:36Z,9,
Alana Montero,"@John Williams It might shock you to discover this but most men don't base their beliefs on what will get women to date them/have sex with them. They have their own identities and views and values. The men (and women because there are women like this too) who base their beliefs, etc. on what appeals to people of the gender/s they're attracted to, who mould their views and identity on making themselves more desirable to people of the gender/s they're attracted to are desperate and needy people who have issues with people-pleasing. It is not healthy. It is also very off-putting to most people and so, ironically, makes it more likely that people who behave in this way will be rejected.

Almost everyone goes for looks, especially initially, regardless of gender. But for most people views and values are also very important. Because you're also looking for a companion and someone with incompatible views is less likely to be a good companion, and people with certain toxic views are almost certain to be bad companions.

Republican males and conservative males in general are not more attractive. They do not have better genetics and they do not have better lifestyle choices. They are more attractive to women who share their values, who like more ""traditional"" men, and who like a more conservative aesthetic. Other women are more attracted to different things and might find conservative men unattractive.

You seem to be confusing fantasy with reality.",2022-06-22T06:46:30Z,13,

Alana Montero,"@Based Sense Birth Firstly, I was making a point using an extreme example. If, as argued, women can have sex with anyone they want to, then no one should be unobtainable. I said ""incredibly attractive celebrity who shall remain nameless"" as an illustration of men that many women might fantasise about but very few would ever have a chance with. Everyone gets rejected and no one can have sex with any person they want to.

As for attractiveness in general. Yes, women, like men, generally prefer to have sex with people we are attracted to than have sex with people we're not attracted to. The only people of any gender who don't feel this way are the desperate - and even then, given the choice they would likely prefer to be having sex with someone they are attracted to. No, women aren't only attracted to ""chads"". Firstly, women are attracted to a broad range of men. Secondly, many women (myself included) don't even find the men who meet the description usually used for ""chads"" attractive. People, including women, have different tastes and different turn-ons.

Women reach out to - and get rejected by - all sorts of men. Yes, more attractive men do get that more but so do more attractive women. Lots of ""normies"" have sex and get into relationships. Most people are normies. Look around you. If what you say was true, then almost all men would be perpetually celibate. But only a small minority of men are perpetually celibate, despite what some might tell themselves. Furthermore, while there are exceptions, most incels are not incels for reasons of physical attractiveness.",2022-06-22T06:26:04Z,11,

Men also fantasise about incredibly attractive celebrities. Most, unless they are delusional, also like women recognise that they don't have a chance of that happening in real life.

Everyone gets rejected. No one can have sex with anyone they want to, especially not average people - and ""average people"" is the vast majority of us. Yes, very attractive women are much less likely to be rejected but the same is true of very attractive men.",2022-06-22T06:16:59Z,11,
SimplySnazzy,"@John Williams You‚Äôre not making any sense. Firstly, there are obviously mindsets that make women less likely to date men (how many women do you see eager to date a ‚Äúblackpilled incel‚Äù?). You talk about women like we are mindless drones whose only focus on life is how attractive men are but we have the same problems you do. We fear rejection. Women want to marry men that have similar convictions and beliefs as us, assuming we are talking about straight women. Also, there are a ton of gorgeous democratic men‚Ä¶republicans are not more likely to land a woman. Republicans are more likely to date republicans and democrats are more likely to date democrats. Why? Because they have similar perspectives. A democratic woman probably won‚Äôt date a republican man because they won‚Äôt agree or get along. 

Some people (men and women both) are superficial enough to place looks above all, but that is not the majority of people. People who focus more on looks will not have healthy relationships. You should reevaluate the way that you view women and how you talk about them. We are just as diverse and nuanced as men are.",2022-06-22T02:00:24Z,23,

At the same time, this was an excellent video- there‚Äôs growth happening in this discussion. I see you applying things from Fiq‚Äôs Manosphere vids that I align with, and rly taking it to the core root of the problem. Patriarchy- which hurts everyone. It‚Äôs the same w racism & White Supremacy as well. No one is free until we are all free. It‚Äôs hard to find empathy for someone who doesn‚Äôt present as wanting to change or dismantle the patriarch that is the cause of the problem but pushes it as a solution, because they get all the privileges from it even tho ultimately, it‚Äôs gonna kill them too. But it‚Äôs the only way if I‚Äôm truly humanizing these men and wanting freedom from oppression for all. Which I do. 
But I‚Äôd be I liar if I said they were prioritized in my life in my personal deconstruction. 
I‚Äôm a white woman, I think this sentiment is often (rightly) felt about us. We‚Äôll take all the benefits of White Supremacy, and fight for things that only benefit us as women. No intersectionality. So I‚Äôm not surprised when in a room of mixed company, no one is interested in our opinions.

Croissant ',"@Konstancja i swear to god i had a date with a tinder guy and i was after work to i wanted to buy coffee, he offered to pay and i said no thanks, but before i could pull out my card he swung in and paid. We went to escape room , i was like ""Hey how much was it?"" ""Oh i paid up front""
I never asked for this
And i felt really uncomfortable because there was no second date and i felt like i owed him money
I can be paid off by somebody when we're close, like my bff, then another time i will pay for her, but if we're strangers im not risking owing  you money
Which actually did happen to my bff! Her guy also force paid for everything and few months later wanted it back
She felt uncomfy all the way through because she doesn't like to feel like she owes people money
I swear to god its ONLY men and usually the insecure ones too",2022-07-20T06:21:02Z,1,

And yes, as humans, we are often living paradoxes and tend to act hypocritically without acknowledging our own words or behaviors. It's quite comical and ironical in a way that so many allistic or NT people could be so unself-aware... ü§≠ Sorry, that was mean of me. My own hypocrisy here.. lol 

 ''Like, I don't have much of an issue with people making fun of hate groups, i just wish they'd do it without being hypocrites. I hated browsing through either community and both made me feel more worthless.''

Yeah. I also don't like body-shaming people, even if I disagree with them. It just causes more shallowness and insecurities in people that might share similar physical traits. That's unfair and immature. 

''I think a lot of this may be result of a sort of 'mutual invalidation' (idk im bad with words), where people invalidate each others experiences for moral superiority, leading the other side to feel angry and perpetuate the cycle.''

You are very wise. I understand mutual invalidation. It really feels like it, eh? 
I think that is why it is important to learn about emotional intelligence and empathy in general. The distance between humans is wider (technologies have good and bad sides, like everything in this Universe) and the pandemic didn't help the sentiments of loneliness, anger, sadness, creating more and more resentment in our humans minds, comforting by our own biases believes as usual (we comfort ourselves in the believes that others are worst than we are, we put ourselves down with the believes we are less than others)...

''God i fucking hate social media. The worst part is how these apps thrive off this toxicity, whether it be twitter, reddit, 4chan or tiktok, the more hateful and addicted people get, the more money theyll make.''

Welcome to Narcissism 2.0. Renewed and improved to fit the new kind of slaver.... I meant consumerism system... Oups, lapsus. Tee-Hee! 

No problem for the ramble. I also like to write ''long'' comments when I have something to say. And I think it easier for people like us because we don't have to deal with too many emotions within us or around us like when we are around people in real life. Oh, no. I forgot that we are supposed to lack empathy, according to some. lol 

*Whispering* : And yet they listen to the real ones who lack empathy and trust them because of their ''charisma'' and power (money).  ü§´

Ok, see. That is my own bias resentment from NT people. We are living paradoxes... Did I told you already? lol

 I think the neurodivergency may explain why I ended up doomscrolling do much when i was mentally ill. I could relate to the loneliness and self hatred of incels, but not their politics, Whereas i agreed with lefty politics but hated how condescending and careless they were. They seemed more than fine with making things worse as long as they felt superior in the end (eg. Making fun of incels for being virgins, ben shapiro for being short, and thus perpetuating patriarchal standards). 
 Like, I don't have much of an issue with people making fun of hate groups, i just wish they'd do it without being hypocrites. I hated browsing through either community and both made me feel more worthless.

I think a lot of this may be result of a sort of 'mutual invalidation' (idk im bad with words), where people invalidate each others experiences for moral superiority, leading the other side to feel angry and perpetuate the cycle. I think the black pill/pink pill thing is a good example with how each communtiy views each other -in the eyes of each community, the other doesnt deserve to exist because their problems are seemingly insignificant. 

God i fucking hate social media. The worst part is how these apps thrive off this toxicity, whether it be twitter, reddit, 4chan or tiktok, the more hateful and addicted people get, the more money theyll make.

Tip Toes,"@hummusiguess I don't disagree with you at all about all of what you said. I also think people are playing tennis games with a lot of political and social issues in general. The Internet has definitely made a lot of us more socially inapt to some dangerous levels for humanity. Creating more division by that. I hate that so many make humans interactions even more complicated. I'm neurodivergent, so it's very confusing to me why some people would do that. You are not pessimistic on this concept. I think you have very good points, actually. You are realistic. I know the feeling. lol... We're fighting the branches and leaves of the problems, without considering their roots. 

As for myself, I'm not uncomfortable to watch these videos or to scroll to see comments. I'm just a very curious person. And I like to see different perspectives or thoughts or feelings that people can express. It makes me understand a little bit more about other humans. I've always been like this. Observing humans to try to understand them. (Must be my neurodivergence.) I don't know. Anyway, enough about me. lol

hummusiguess,"@Tip Toes yeah I can see how it could help people know who to avoid; but I do also get the feeling it does more harm than good. OP has been left feeling as if dating as a whole is just too risky (an idea which she obviously is allowed to believe and practice).

 I don't think this is really going to sort out the wider issues at play here, and I think what's happening to OP is something eerily similar to what's  happening to red pillers, where so many unhappy people are staying online and watching videos that make them hurt, while also damaging how they view other humans and social interaction as a whole. And i think one of the most insideous parts of this is how it can be masked as 'education', where you convince yourself you're just listening to people tell it like it is (take the similarities between red and pink pillers for example).

Maybe i'm pessimistic, but i don't think we currently have the kind of political tools (neither the understanding of what causes this, or the support structures to prevent it) to really adress these problems. 

Like, OP's comment isn't very popular, so why did you feel the need to scroll through all these comments? Do you really feel like you've learned valuable lessons you could've learned without making yourself so uncomfortable? The same goes for me too obviously, even though I'm a guy. I think we're all just collectively watching content that makes us feel bitter and miserable so we can excuse not making an effort to actually persue change irl (maybe idk just conjecture).

I don't mean to be condescending - not to you, nor OP, but I really don't think 'the left' really had any good solutions to some of these problems yet, which is concerning i guess.",2022-06-14T11:35:38Z,4,

It also reinforces the idea that men want sex more than women and it feeds the fresh and fit narrative of ""attention for women is like sex for men"". A much better gendered comparisons would be ""then u have to cook and do his laundry for him""",2022-06-13T22:56:33Z,0,0

Do you respect women so little that you think they can‚Äôt think for themselves?

Then the solution is: ‚Äúnothing is a woman‚Äôs fault. When women take advantage of men, it‚Äôs men‚Äôs fault again.‚Äù

Adios dude, hope you work on whatever you've got going on there. 

P.S. I'm not a feminist, I just read a lot of feminist theory to know where my views divert from theirs.",2022-06-14T02:48:44Z,3,
Thomas Foolery,"@Luci Evelyn  haha. Translation: ‚ÄúCrap. This guy is smarter than I thought he was. He really logically cornered me with that point about how our feminist mainstream movements never call out women like they do to men. I‚Äôll say I won‚Äôt be responding any further to save face before he completely dismantles my entire world view.‚Äù

You don‚Äôt have to respond anymore. I understand you need to save face. I‚Äôll respond to your last post for anyone else following this thread.

I have read very widely. I‚Äôm using a pseudonym for fun here, but I‚Äôve actually debated some of the top feminists that have best selling books that you probably parrot your talking points from.

One big misconception on your part is the idea that feminism moves in a line of progress over time and anyone who isn‚Äôt using your latest jargon is simply behind. Are you not aware that there are many conflicting ideas within the wider feminism movement? For example, is sex work empowering to women or is it exploitative? There are many prominent feminists who disagree here. The entire movement is a series of overlapping Venn diagrams. The one line of feminism you were indoctrinated by is likely the line your liberals arts classes all coalesced around. There is a ton of feminist literature that contradicts the points you seem to see as set in stone. I don‚Äôt owe it to you to magically figure out which line of feminism you were indoctrinated by. However, I happen to be familiar with all of them.

You missed the point about buzzfeed young one. Yes, I know all of you gen Z kids use tiktok now. Hilarious considering you don‚Äôt understand that the CCP owns that and it designs the algo to nudge your ideological views to where it wants it, but that‚Äôs a separate point. I used Buzzfeed to make a point about ‚Äúmainstream feminism‚Äù. Buzzfeed, NYT, etc represent what is accepted as the correct mainstream position. You can find anyone with any position on social media. Yet, they won‚Äôt be having their TikTok videos studied and reviewed as the class textbook in college. There is a wider ideological debate about what is the correct mainstream position, and that‚Äôs what shapes the minds of America not some dumb tiktok edge lords.

The mainstream feminist position is inherently hypocritical. That is my point. I don‚Äôt particularly care for whatever fringe part of feminism you happen to adhere to this week. It holds no power over society unless it gets folded into the mainstream position which is how laws are shaped and class curriculums are decided.

Your attempt to point out the difference in weight between using men for food and abortion laws was illogical. You could have just compared it to mansplaining to make it of equal weight. First of all, I never mentioned abortion, you did, in order to give weight to your comparison. Second of all, it isn‚Äôt the weight that matters it‚Äôs the logical consistency. When you come up with some abstract ideological explanation to justify bad female behavior for petty issues, you should do the same for men. That is my point.

Lastly, I‚Äôd like for you to grasp the concept that newly written feminist literature isn‚Äôt science. There are no proofs. There is no QED moment. It is literally nothing more than ideological opinions. Hilarious considering that‚Äôs exactly what manosphere content is. Guys like Rollo Tomassi have written a ton of books and it is the ‚Äúmasculinist‚Äù equivalent. It is all religious thinking on both sides. It‚Äôs their vision of how society should deal with the genders and why it makes the most sense. If you take away nothing from our exchange, please wrap your head around only this. If you can‚Äôt grasp this, you‚Äôll be recruited into a cult at some point in your life and go around parroting the words of the cult leader for the rest of your life making him rich.",2022-06-14T02:34:57Z,0,
Luci Evelyn,"@Thomas Foolery This just indicates you haven't read very widely, and that you are either a) not understanding my points, b) not reading carefully or c) deliberately misconstruing them. Nowhere did I say ""don't call out those things"", although you must exist in quite the echo chamber if you haven't seen the thousands of tik toks and memes calling out that behaviour in women. 

But, if buzzfeed is your reference point then perhaps you aren't super ""with the times"". 

Your language choices of what to do with men saying misogynist stuff is also very telling. If you think it's ""shaming"" and ""forcing them to conform"" then I really don't think you have a particularly good understanding of the issues. You also are equating two things that are in no way equal. Women's reproductive freedom is being erroded because of the views around women at this very moment. Women using men for free food does not have this widespread implication. 

My points are relevant. You are the one lacking in knowledge of feminist theory if you think that definition is remotely current. Not even the older feminist theorists use such a simplistic view (e.g. De Beauvoir). 

Because of your continued lack of understanding of my point, and refusal to address any of what I say, I'm not going to bother to respond further. I see no value in continuing to talk to someone who is a) ignorant of the topic and b) arrogant and rude in asserting that ignorance and c) refuses to engage properly. It's intellectually lazy on your part, and quite frankly you aren't up to scratch on the definitions and concepts, not to mention potential damage of one activity vs. another. 

Do better. Read more. I sincerely hope you can do your research and read more widely, in order to come to a deeper and better understanding that isnt coloured by your own perceived victimhood. I'd love for providing free food to be the only risk to my gender.",2022-06-14T01:54:08Z,3,
Thomas Foolery,"@Luci Evelyn you are redefining it. The definition of Patriarchy I used isn‚Äôt the first definition, it‚Äôs the ideological definition. Your definition has drifted from the ideological definition by feminists before you. Frankly, it doesn‚Äôt really add/remove from the discussion, but I point it out to say that it‚Äôs absurd for you to expect me to know which non-textbook feminist definition you‚Äôre using and blame that on me as if I didn‚Äôt do the appropriate research. It says a lot about your entitlement.

‚ÄúThese women are at fault, but that won‚Äôt change until you change the underlying system.‚Äù 

It isn‚Äôt that I don‚Äôt understand this. It‚Äôs that you‚Äôre wrong. When men have a patriarchal view of things such as ‚Äúwomen should raise the children‚Äù you call men backwards and sexist and shame them until they conform to your viewpoint. You don‚Äôt dodge the point then say,‚Äùmen feel this way because of the patriarchy. We need to dismantle that system or men won‚Äôt change.‚Äù Lol.

Men and women are equal right? So hold them accountable like you do to men. Write some buzzfeed article with the headline,‚ÄùLadies, your backwards expectation for men to pay for you is misandrist and reinforcing the patriarchy. Do better.‚Äù

No single raindrop thinks they‚Äôre responsible for the flood. Be the change you want to see in the world.",2022-06-14T00:55:59Z,1,
Luci Evelyn,"@Thomas Foolery If you think the dictionary definition is the one being used by feminist theorists, with no expansion, you're the one ill informed. As I've said, look into more nuanced understandings, because that's what we're working off. 

Women using men for free food, partially part of patriarchal conditioning that men are supposed to pay for dates. That's what is meant by systemic problem. Those women are at fault. But that wont change until you address the underlying system of values and behaviours that allow for it. I''m not sure why you don't understand this? It's really not very complicated. 

And, I am on topic. I'm explaining why even the definition you listed doesn't just ""mean men"". And then explaining what people mean BEYOND the dictionary when they say ""patriarchy"". You listed a dictionary answer and failed to comprehend even the implications of that.

I'm sorry, but I think you're too caught up in your own agenda here to be able to have an actual conversation. And that's me being charitable to you and your capacity for reason and reading comprehension.

P.S. expansion on a definitions based on the academia from that field is not ""redefining"" it.",2022-06-14T00:25:15Z,5,
Thomas Foolery,"@Luci Evelyn I literally wrote the textbook definition of Patriarchy and you redefined it in front of me and called me misinformed. 

Then you went on a tangent about things that society could do to help women without addressing what Noah was suggesting when he said women aren‚Äôt at fault for using men for free food it‚Äôs ‚Äúthe patriarchy‚Äù.

If you want to have a discussion, stay on topic. In 2022, when women openly admit that they use men for free food, is it possible for women to be at fault? Or is it the patriarchy‚Äôs fault.",2022-06-14T00:12:10Z,0,
Luci Evelyn,"@Thomas Foolery No, neither of those things is correct. It's about the system itself, and the attitudes it promulgates (which harm men, women and non binary people).


 It's not about replacing men with women. There are plenty of women in power who are vile people. Margaret Thatcher for instance. Replacing the men who get to the top of the system with women won't change that system.  It's about addressing things that make it more difficult for women, like abortion access, and childcare. As well as the culture that arises from praising the most aggressive form of masculinity, and devalues femininity. These are just some of what people are talking about when they say patriarchy. It's far more systemic and you don't seem to grasp that.

 So I reiterate. Maybe look into what your interlocutors are saying before debating your misinformed view of a concept.",2022-06-13T23:36:28Z,5,

Alyson Martin,"10:15 I applaud you for this video, Noah, because I think it‚Äôs a message these men need to hear. I‚Äôm also glad to see that spaces for feminist men have begun forming online. What I‚Äôm hearing is that there are no safe spaces for men to discuss the parts of the patriarchy that affect them negatively‚Ä¶and that‚Äôs why many of them find comfort within the manosphere. But men need to set these spaces up for themselves and each other, the same way non-men have. That‚Äôs not something the rest of us can, should, or will do for men.

Yeah, I can see women perpetuating shitty ideas around men and their emotions, and they shouldn‚Äôt do that, but still the quote you shared on this topic rubbed me the wrong way. It implies that women are a significant source of the derision that keeps men closeting their emotions, which it provides no measurable basis for‚Ä¶men made the patriarchal rules, benefit the most from patriarchal privilege, and yet women are being called out for not ‚Äúrewarding‚Äù men for getting in touch with their feelings? If you‚Äôve unpacked your shit and understand why emotions and gender equality are important, that should‚Äôve been the reward in and of itself. You shouldn‚Äôt be a feminist just to get positive female attention, you should do it because it‚Äôs morally correct and is better for everyone.

*At the end of the day, no one has more power to relieve themselves from the influence of the patriarchy than men.* And until ya‚Äôll start really talking to each other instead of continuing to point out how the rest of us are doing it wrong, we‚Äôre not getting anywhere.",2022-06-13T21:01:57Z,28,5
RatPfink66,"@Alyson Martin well, one thing we know as men is that _other men will not_ support us on that journey as a rule, and indeed, will often do what they can to invalidate it.

djangogeek,"@Alyson Martin Consider this: slavery could not have ended without hundreds of thousands of white people dying to end it. Does that mean that there were no black soldiers who fought in the war? Of course not. Even though it was white peoples responsibility to end slavery, black soldiers also fought proudly to end the institution, *and it couldn't have happened without them.*

Wouldn't it make sense then, that the war to end patriarchy will need women to proudly fight alongside men to end that* institution as well? Because much in the same way, *it can't happen without women.* To brush it off as ""not my fight not my problem"" is far too short sighted.",2022-06-14T00:44:27Z,1,
Alyson Martin,"@Noah Samsen thank you for the clarification. I haven‚Äôt read that book - I‚Äôll put it on my reading list! And you‚Äôre welcome üíõ I love your videos and the discussions you start.

I still can‚Äôt help but be a bit plucked. Women have had to build upon the victories around our own liberation without the support or validation of men/society at large. The rhetoric that red pill men need our validation and understanding to do the right thing by them and us feels like asking too much. It‚Äôs hard to consolidate that feeling. Maybe hooks has a point that would help with that.",2022-06-13T22:49:01Z,2,
Noah Samsen,"I think ""reward"" is meant to refer to just like, validation, and understanding more than anything else (as opposed to derision or scorn as hooks points out). Reward in this sense shouldn't be a motivation, but without it, it really is difficult for those most affected to be able to grow. I definitely agree that the quote by itself implies significant blame on the part of women, but the rest of that chapter (and book) make it very clear that the harm will always ultimately fall on the side of the oppressed, which is women under patriarchy. It's a synthesis between those two notions (Men ultimately are the oppressors in a systemic manner + Men are hurt by this same system and ignoring that pain hurts us all in the long run). It's a good read if you haven't! Also, thanks for the nice comment!",2022-06-13T21:19:36Z,13,

Jaistashu,"As a femme non-binary, it's my understanding that each person should go into the date expecting to pay for whatever they order for themselves. If I order a bottle of wine, then I pay for that bottle of wine, and I share said wine. If my date orders the appetizer, they pay for it. If I want any, I'll ask their permission before I eat some of the appetizer they ordered. I don't like the idea of ""splitting"" the check bc it implies evenly splitting the total when what each person ordered more likely than not ranges in price. If I ordered chicken tenders for 10 bucks and my date ordered steak for 22 bucks, I don't think it's fair for me to pay 16 bucks and vice versa.

Ultimately, I hate the idea that a man or masc person is expected to pay for everything not only bc it's the gateway thought into ""I bought you things so now you owe me sex"", but also bc men have bills, too. I don't want my spending time with my date to hang on whether or not I've burned through too much of their money.

Regardless of that intention, she ends up getting shut down because then she's tasked with addressing his feelings instead.

the long term depressed people are the ones at the worst risk, because to get to acceptance, they need to adopt a normie attitude to the extra jolt of depression that comes with rejection, and simply hurt and be tough and take action.

it's a risk because they may not know HOW to act like a normie. they may do themselves or others damage, or they may do nothing.",2022-09-14T12:44:25Z,1,

nena,"@Pain Unending I agree with everything you've said here. It's true that many women aren't able to deal with their spouses feelings and the reason behind that is because of the way we all are born into standards and expectations concerning gender roles. The same goes for men. My comment was mostly referring to how absurd it is to promote the notion that you shouldn't be able to tell your significant other about your feelings as a man. In any healthy relationship between adults it would be very strange to not have proper communication, hence the elementary school girlfriend comment. I understand that your experience with unemapthetic women is real, and I hope you don't meet anyone like that again.",2022-06-19T15:27:13Z,0,
Pain Unending,"@nena It is true. I've heard from many men both online and irl talk about how when they opened up to their girlfriends/wives there became a significant divide in the relationship, some of them eventually led to the relationship breaking down. All because these women weren't ready to handle their men being vulnerable. This is a real thing

Men often aren't equipped to handle their own emotions, this is something thats been recognised by many people. The flip side is that women also aren't equipped to handle their male spouses emotions as well. Some think they are but the programming that our society instills in us prevents them from really doing so

Women grow up with the same gender roles instilled in them. The same way many men hold onto 'boys don't cry', women do just the same

Like I once saw a woman describe male vulnerability as 'being able to cry at a romcom'. It's a Disney image of vulnerability. Real vulnerability can be ugly, and a lot of times women aren't able to handle it",2022-06-19T13:52:10Z,0,

75th,"@Keylanos Lokj Not really. Zoosk pulled data from over 40 million users and at all ages, even in their 50's, men typically only matched with women around their own age anyway. Their entire life, the woman was consistently only like 1-5 years younger. And that's consistent with all other stats we have showing the average age gap of couples being 1-4 years, even in older age. Slightly higher gap the older you are. Only 10% of relationships have an age gap of ten years and it shrinks the farther apart the couple is in age. So doesn't seem age has much to do with marriage or dating and their pool wouldn't really grow at all because they turned 30. It shrinks, for everyone since the best matches already paired up. 

Especially since men at 40 only have about a 5% chance of getting with a 20 year old, so they can't really go much younger anyway because women by far prefer men around their own age, or slightly younger when they get older. So for men who refuse to date their own age and only chase younger women they are almost guaranteed to erase themselves from the gene pool. There are more young women than young men, and women only start to dominate in terms of numbers once men start dying off at around 60-65 years old. So before then, there really aren't enough women to go around because more men are born. 

Doesn't add up either way. After 60, sure. Senior men definitely have a slightly larger pool because there are more women than men. But before then not at all. Maybe it's because young women are more naive in what they want. Then they get older and are more picky because they refuse to waste their time on assholes. Maybe men just get who they can, then. That's the only way I can see that working out, is if men lower their standards whether in age or looks. 

Which means women would be the gate keepers of marriage at that point, because they refuse to lower their standards and are happier to remain single with friends than with the wrong man.",2022-07-01T03:13:23Z,3,

Good reason for it too, there are a lot of concerns about their safety. Generally men gatekeep who they want to marry... especially these days. Marriage can be a risky endeavor and if a man does choose to marry a woman, he is either dumb with little foresight or really sees himself with this woman long term and well worth the risks financially. Of course I think what really complicates all of this, we're in the middle of financial and cultural shifts. Men are generally still expected to ask a woman out and take the risk of rejection. Women are working more now and in a growing number of cases, earning more than their prospective partners and often it's still frowned upon to date a man that makes less. All summed up, men and women are still rooted in some traditional aspects while we've been propelled well ahead in some areas. Change while for the better can be an ugly transformative process.

Also this same logic applies the other way around. If a man told a woman, I require my date to have sex with me (beforehand) the woman can decide oh no. I don't want it.

I've witness & experience so much female on male abuse (same with my friends) that I've lost count in comparison to male on female abuse, because IT'S ACCEPTED & SWEPT UNDER THE RUG BY OTHER MEN AND COMPLETELY IGNORED BY WOMEN. I've seen more Johnny Depp/Amber Heard & Will Smith/Jada Smith type of relationship abuse/fuckery than Chris Brown/Rhianna & Whitney Huston/Bobby Brown situations.

EJ,"@ApotheosiZ Ah okay, I see where there‚Äôs been some miscommunication. The term ‚Äòpatriarchy‚Äô doesn‚Äôt refer to simply older men in positions of power (though the imbalance of men to women in higher paid positions is another example).

It refers to the prevalent social attitudes, laws, values and norms that exist that largely work in favour of men in general.

It is a nebulous concept cos it‚Äôs not something you can physically see, but rather something that has cultural and societal effects. Kinda like racism. It‚Äôs not an item or a something you can touch, but we can absolutely notice the negative effects.

When people use the term patriarchy, it‚Äôs certainly not a catch all term to excuse away poor behaviour. Everyone is responsible for their actions. It‚Äôs more a tool to help explain how people‚Äôs behaviours can be influenced, consciously or unconsciously, by the world around them. 

Neither women nor men are expressly saying, ‚Äòyou must act this way or else‚Äô. No one expects special treatment, just to be respected, treated as an equal, and allowed to feel safe around others. 

What problems do you think would become worse? Honestly asking",2022-06-14T06:30:27Z,3,
ApotheosiZ,"@EJ yeah but all of this is nuance... What is a guy suppose to do when women reinforce the same sentiments of ""men needing to be masculine & dominant"" while preaching equality & feminism yet expecting chivalry & special treatment?

What does that have to do with patriarchal hierarchies aka older men in positions of power? Especially if most women (& men) claim to despise them... I don't really think that the 20 to 25 year old women I saw at the club on Saturday playing games with guys and flirting with other men in front of their boyfriends (probably a few of them cheated on their current partners that night) happens because of a patriarchal society, if anything that sounds more like Darwinism & survival of the fittest.

I don't really like or agree with how a woman's (or a man's) poor behaviour, mindset, and actions can just be placed on something else like the patriarchy or some other ideological structure, I feel like it delineates and takes away from finding a proper conclusion to the problem.

The patriarchy is already collapsing but a lot of these problems continue to morph & mutate into something different, that (from my perspective) seems considerably worse.",2022-06-13T23:09:30Z,0,
EJ,"@ApotheosiZ sure, so it‚Äôs not so much that it *causes* anyone to abuse anyone else.

Largely because patriarchal attitudes reinforce the idea the men have to be strong, masculine or dominant always.

Using that lens, if a man isn‚Äôt seen as being those stereotypical ideals of what a man ‚Äòshould‚Äô be, then it lays the groundwork for cases of abuse where a woman is the perpetrator to be dismissed",2022-06-13T20:50:51Z,1,

 Is it the men and women turning the other cheek because they don‚Äôt see what‚Äôs happening as abuse?

Is it the men pointing and laughing at other men because ‚Äúyou‚Äôre supposed to be the man of the house,‚Äù ‚Äúyou‚Äôre weak,‚Äù ‚Äúwhy‚Äôd you let a woman treat you like that?‚Äù

- Alright lets abolish patriarchy than... like it hasn't been getting deconstructed for the last 40-50 plus years.

It's like nearly all women are on the same page when it comes physical features they like. I think I'm gonna die alone because women all want the same man, a man I can't be.

 Despite your claims, women are more likely to stay the entire date with an online date that lied about their looks than men in the same situation. They're also more likely to arrange a second date than men in the same situation. 

I've dated a VAST array of men whose looks range from funky to hot to just plain interesting (and body types all over that same spectrum); I was attracted to all of them. When women deviate from your assumptions,  it's easier to think we're liars than to admit that maybe you're just doing something that's not working. 

I like men who are active (because I'm active and lack patience to wait on them being slow), fit-ish (like me, a little beef and a little squish), who have amazing brains (because I need an intellectual equal more than I need looks), and a nice smile (because I want to smile with them). I prefer my height or taller because I can... and because when I HAVE tried dating men shorter, they've always ghosted me, so I associate shorter men with that. Personality-wise, focused, stable/reliable, honest, non-threatening/kind, and fairly good-natured (because we all have bad days).

While they're not common, I've met a few women who exclusively date men shorter than themselves. I've had female friends who like the lean nerdy look, the effeminate looking dude, the dad bod guys, the pretty man, and/or the squishy cuddle bears,  etc... because different strokes for different folks. 
Maybe you should work on yourself. I mean that genuinely and sincerely. Because clearly, whatever you're doing, and whoever you're trying to date, isn't working for you.",2022-08-11T03:28:25Z,1,

Emu,"@Clueless Drifter Not trying to come at you at all cus you seem genuine in wanting to have civil conversation, so I hope my comment comes off the same way :) Also I apologize if you already discussed this later in the thread, I really can't keep reading further down.
I do want to put it out there, that the exact same argument can be said of men. Ie: ""Ask a random man on the street what they find attractive and you'll hear the same stuff. Skinny, big boobs, big ass, blonde(maybe redhead), 'child-bearing hips' and small waist."" The thing is, I know that statement is not at all true for every man, it's just the loudest dudes proudly proclaiming their preferences, and often only hurts women who can't meet that standard.
The exact same thing happens with women. To say all women like jawlines and muscles, tall, what have you, is just false, and a wide generalization. Like with men, this generalization exists because the loudest women proudly proclaim their preferences, and by doing so, only hurt men who cannot reach them. (Also as a side note, I am a woman and actually do not find any of those physical traits attractive. I much prefer shorter men, and preferably without a jaw that will cut me lmaoo. Lean is a big no for me too).
I think it's harmful to take what we have seen and heard from a small group of loud people and use it as evidence of one side being ""less individualistic"", especially because the individualality discussion is much too close in theory to the intellect discussion (Of course you were not linking the two, but often they are hand in hand). I know when I was younger I used to think all men were ""single-minded, with their only goal being sex"" and yeah, there are men out there like that, but it is harmful to act on it as if fact and not just my perspective. Especially since that idea is false, and I feel the same way with your generalization. It is all too easy to find evidence of women seemingly being single-minded and liking the same things, but it's only a small portion of women. To portray it as all women is harmful.
Not to mention, both women and men's  personal preferences on the other gender have been sorta taught generation to generation. We were taught that skinnier was more attractive and that bigger(not obese) was sickly and unhealthy. Similar beauty standards have been born from the patriarchy for decades if not centuries. These beauty standards effect both men and women of course, but is the reason the loud people in each group feel so comfortable announcing it and even applying it to others.
I mean, take one look at modelling agencies and see what they are searching for in models. Modelling agencies make money off models that are appealing to a general audience. And since more often than not, these agencies are heavily driven by money, you will see more often the models they hire are the ones most likely physically attractive to the largest audience.
There was something else I'd wanted to say, but it has slipped my mind and I think this comment is already too long haha.",2022-07-19T02:30:07Z,3,

One of my favorite Red Pill YouTubers, Sterling Cooper? He talks about how what guys will describe as a 6-7 will usually treat guys who approach them badly because they think that the GUY thinks they see them as a quick lay. 

Then we have girls who guys refer to as 8-10s. If you‚Äôre a hot guy, they will treat you with respect and be kind. If you‚Äôre not, then prepare to be treated with contempt. 

Now, as for why the red pillers think no woman is nice?

Well, they are half right‚Ä¶.but not for the reasons they think.

Allison Hart,"‚Äã@Markov Chain I apologize for leading with a derisive tone right out of the gate. It's just that, I've debated a lot of people who self-identify as MGTOW/MRA/etc. and most of them view women as subhuman NPCs, or at least inferior to them in some way. They will claim that that's not what MGTOW is about, but then say ""all women are the same."" So, I'm already on the defensive in that sense, and, sorry for that.

(Also ATLA is awesome) 

But, you did start out with what I see as an assumption that women are liars if they give that answer to the question, and I feel it would be difficult for you to prove that claim. I mean, there's the whole ""Clearly women don't care about a man being smart, funny, having hobbies, etc. because they won't date a man under 6 feet,"" but this is exactly the argument I have a problem with. Sure, some women won't date a man under 6 feet tall, but some will. To say ""women do X or don't do Y"" seems like an essentialist argument to me and, I get that the point being made is that even if there are a few exceptions it doesn't change the ""rule"" about women. But regardless, it is coming from a stance that most/all women are fundamentally a certain way. Fundamentally ""hypergamous,"" for example. 

""But most guys today (in the west or Murica at least.) are single and celibate.""

I feel like there are too many factors as to why this is, to boil it down to women only caring about looks. I think it's more like, dating apps and technology are destructive and alienating, but not in the way TRP means; it's more like, romance being boiled down to a photo, a sentence, and an algorithm is a recipe for people becoming isolated, cut off from reality, and disillusioned. Rather than a problem of ""the women on the dating apps,"" it's the dating apps themselves, and our hedonistic, quick-entertainment society, that don't promote genuine connections between people anymore.

About your last argument ‚Äì isn't part of the belief system of the red-pilled man that all women share the ""same nature""? Manipulative etc.? So I'm confused by the argument that they don't fall for nice women. Since as far as they believe, nice women don't exist, right?",2022-06-15T14:51:09Z,25,

What do I mean? What we find physically attractive and what you referred to as ‚Äúwhat we find attractive ‚Äú are not differentiations people tend to make when asked that question.

There are no shortage of guys with admirable traits. 

Smart, kind, good values, coders. But most guys today (in the west or Murica at least.) are single and celibate.

One more thing: you should know that most red pill guys are unaware of this? But they have a type.

Digaddog,"@Corduroy's Cloverleaf I don't understand your logic.  Gender stereotypes tend to mirror each other, right?  If we associate trait with gender, then we must associate other trait with other gender, or else there is no difference.  While I don't deny that women are stereotyped as weak, men are stereotyped as dangerous.  You choose to focus on the former stereotype, even when the latter stereotype is most relevant, as in court cases.  

There are a couple reasons this matters, mostly implicit reasons.  First off, it portrays the women's stereotype as the one in need of change.  I have to wonder, is it really better to charge women more time or men less?  In some cases, maybe, but in general, men being treated as dangerous is much more important, especially where intersectionality applies. 

Second, oftentimes this is just an extension of more sexism.  Theres this thing called gamma bias and an extension of it called ASCHITI model.  These go over how we attempt to minimize mens issues and portray women as agency-less.  We perpetuate these problems when we choose to portray mens issues as misogyny. 

Third, this drives the men we're trying to help away.  They see their issues minimized and they look for people who don't minimize their issues.  When they come across people like us, they're receptive at first, but the moment we frame their issues as something against women, they believe that we're the same as everyone else who minimizes their issues.  I recall a couple days ago, there was an article that said feminists found the draft sexist because it said women were weak, and someone replied something like, ""for a second there I was worried we cared about men.""  Theres this idea in MRA circles that feminists believe that equality will trickle down.

Fourth, I worry people care about performative progressivism more than actual progressive ideology.  I've seen people get away with tradcon beliefs in progressive spaces just because they scapegoated the patriarchy for their problems. 

Fifth, what about the cases in which sexism can not directly be attributed to patriarchy?  The instances in which an attempt at progressive policy, or women using soft or hard power to cause a change, can instead be shown to cause sexism?  I mean, this thread basically started by a progressive treating women as a monolith, even though some of the examples shown in this video (for example, paying for the first date) are shown from the perspective of a woman.  Examples of these can be found in actual policy as well.  This causes the same type of people who we discussed in point three to think, ""some of these people do care, but what's the point if they can't pinpoint the causes?""

I wont say we can't analyze these issues through these lenses, just keep some things in mind. 

1.  Dont use this as a tool to minimize issues men face or their other causes.  Dont use it as a whataboutism.  

2.  Women aren't a monolith, and they're not always that progressive.  Every time I see a male survivor post about about their experience, someone without fail brings up how either women are more accepting than men.  Whenever I see a man talk about how he was treated afterwards, they contradict this.  The data we have also shows this.  I see similar problems with makeup/gender expression.  This isn't to say that all women are like this, just that we shouldn't automatically assume one way or the other.  

3.  Keep in mind the times that progressivism, as opposed to patriarchy, caused problems for men, even if they're rare.  I see people support the Duluth model to this day, for example.  Leftists tend to fight long lasting systematic issues, so I feel they tend to see the world as more static than it actually is.

The video kept point 1 and 2 in mind, so I don't have as much of a problem with it.",2022-06-15T01:52:37Z,6,

I watched the video some time ago and this man literally implied that whenever a man spent money on a woman that gives him some free right to have sex whenever he wanted. He basically told a woman in the crowd that because she wanted her man to spend on her, that was okay. It just reminded me of a time when women had literally no choice but to depend on their man for money and that dutch bag most likely thinks the entitlement the men had and still have is okay cause they pay bills. Listen..... Women can want to be stay at home moms or wives and not go to work, without feeling like they're now objects to never say no to their husband or boyfriend jeez.",2022-06-13T17:29:08Z,4,2

In the case of traditionalism, that has pros and cons and it doesn't include rape. Traditionalists are likely to wait for marriage anyway. The second and most realistic option is simply a common courtesy. If you want a woman to pay, find one who will. Just have a discussion before you pay to figure out who will pay. I personally wouldn't care if I had to pay each time if I knew beforehand that's what would happen. I'm more worried about dangers to my safety than dangers to my wallet lol. I do feel like if there is a financial difference between the two that should be considered. That's likely why traditionally the man paid.

So when a lady is on a date with a man that treats everyone, he cares about but her its a sign he not interest worst if he treats a lady friend in front of the gf but if asked about he didn't think of including gf so yeah if a lady feeling a man she will hope he pays since he is telling her she is worth it not treating is saying you're not attractive and he didn't have options. Women are opposite they are fast pulling out the wallet if they are repulse and don't want to see you again that is a way of saying I don't owe you any more of my time get lost leave me alone. Including the girl your with just is a reflex to males when they truly like someone.

a.a,"I think the way Noah put it was correct. It was definitely a lopsided comparison, but I don't think his point was ""they are both unfair expectations, therefore if the man pays, you should sleep with him"", I think his point was that neither is good.

Ian,"Restaurants were historically often segregated for lunch service, with women allowed only in groups of other women and/or restricted to private dining areas. More respectable/upper-class restaurants would refuse entry to single women in the evenings driven by the fear/moral panic that they might be sex workers soliciting clients. That said it was not uncommon to have back door accommodations attached to the same establishments for single men and women to intermingle out of view from polite society.

The reason men traditionally pay is because women did not traditionally work and when you're an old-timey man courting an old-timey young woman, you are the only only one who CAN pay. Paying for the meal is part of showing your feathers; it's proving that you can support/provide or whatever. This persists into the modern day because people are weird.",2022-06-14T20:30:37Z,51,

A space for them to comfortably explore and redefine their masculinity, to question the angry projections they've had shoveled on them for decades, to find a supportive community headed by welcoming, understanding, compassionate, well-studied people who themselves embody a healthier picture of masculinity and manhood. The next wave of content creators really needs to be that. It will save lives, it will put other people out of harm's way, it can reverse a culture of anger and control and blame.... they need to be saved with agitprop just as neonazis got redirected by a wave of dedicated (if fallible) political streamers.

Right wing reddit is horrifyingly racist homophobic and triggering. But i always gotta watch what i say on left wing reddit. I was banned from r/communism for saying that trotsky was not some evil dude trying to destroy the ussr and that his book revolution betrayed highlighted exactly how the ussr would dissolve( beauracracy and lack of democratic control in some aspects of the  economy) which then lead to reformists like gorbachev giving in to capitalism.

Pattern Recon,"A woman is an adult female human. Prior to adulthood, a female human is referred to as a girl (a female child or adolescent). The plural women is sometimes used in certain phrases such as ""women's rights"" to denote female humans regardless of age. Denoting the sex that can bear offspring or produce eggs, distinguished biologically by the production of gametes (ova) which can be fertilized by male gametes.

A¬†man¬†is an adult¬†male¬†human.
Prior to adulthood, a male human is referred to as a¬†boy¬†(a male¬†child¬†or¬†adolescent). 
Like most other male¬†mammals, a man's¬†genome inherits an¬†X¬†chromosome¬†from the mother and a¬†Y¬†chromosome¬†from the father.¬†Sex differentiation¬†of the male fetus is governed by the¬†SRY¬†gene on the Y chromosome. During puberty, hormones which stimulate androgen production result in the development of¬†secondary sexual characteristics, thus exhibiting greater differences between the sexes.

Ty,@Donnie Lou I think these things definitely should contribute to a relationship but then ask yourself why people cheat. It's mostly just because they are sexually tempted at the time and throw all of these long term things which you mentioned out the window. Therefore i feel that looks carry much more weight than any of the above if you have an average personality. That is why a women will much rather choose someone who is sexually attracted to rather than someone who is a 1/10 and has all of these qualities. It's just an uncomfortable truth that looks make up about 70% of who you choose to date but we just don't say it because we don't want to seem shallow. Adultery/cheating is also the leading cause of divorces and 50% of marriages end in divorce which just goes to show how insignificant these things really are. We don't get a full brief of someone's morals just from sleeping with them which also goes to show how insignificant those things are since you don't really have a long enough changes to for someone to get to know your morals from a one night stand.,2022-06-13T22:14:11Z,2,

Any other girls/women out there feeling low about yourself: You DO deserve love and to be treated well. It's better to be alone than to be used and thrown away or treated horribly.

Zen Raloc,"@Christian Wallace I see, well you're not wrong with that last statement. Pity Parties never Prosper XD. And I can agree with some of that. Especially regarding generalization. But the OPs point was to suggest that it happens to women too, because people think it doesn't happen to woman and only happens to men. Which is just not true. It happens to both at varying degrees depending on what, when, and where.
Personally I see the issues more so in the manner of people to people. I don't feel like using the patriarchy theory (I say loosely because I believe we have moved past that already) arguement is not constructive because it eludes to the full responsibilities all parties have towards how they act as humans. I don't think it's fair to merely suggest people are under influence still from gender roles. That's too easy. I feel as though it also stems from everyone's ability to evade concern for others feelings. People are less so in control of their own emotions and less capable of hearing out others and communicating than they should be. And to be honest I think that happens to do with other factors like, ego, self importance, impatience. People are influenced and told to adhere to confidence but they oversell it and end up being too boxed in and defective. People are overly naturally defensive even when it's an outward conversation about another person opinion, (they attack), and alot of our current technology habitually lowers are patience for proper and full communication. It's a serious issue.
I dont disagree with their still being some individuals influenced by the patriarch though. They should've moved past gender roles and thinking that females are lesser beings quite some time ago.
Some people are even contrarian. Such as extreme feminists and meninists who don't understand actual gender equality.",2022-06-13T20:29:16Z,3,

Zen Raloc,"@briansupermega I definitely can recognize they are treated more favorably in certain manners. Such as emotional expression. But not all manners. And in many ways they are still treated poorly. And this is still by the same people who want men to be able to be heard more aswell. Alot of people push the notion of equality but don't actually believe in real equality such as extremist meninists/feminists
I wasn't disputing that woman in this case get more favouritism. And if i was it wouldnt make me brainwashed. It'd just be a different experience and perception in life than yours. Don't be so close minded. I wonder if you even read what I said. The other guy mentioned that men Don't get to express themself AT ALL, that's not true. Relationships and expression  are also alot more common and balanced than people realize nowadays. There are plenty of woman who will hear out man express themself. Out of the 30ish woman I've dated in my life so far I can only think of one that didn't validate my opinion or emotional expression. And I'm very exceptional at communicating.

Which brings up another issue by the way. Alot of the times people want to be heard but not hear others. Why should a man/woman have to listen to their partner if their partner never listens to them.
Most men I know that think they are emotionally validated, care less about the opinion of their partner than theirs and don't communicate well.
The biggest reason this exists is because of a personal non gender specific trait that someone has. It's not a patriarchal thing (which by the way, was developed by men). Stop pretending the patriarch still had influence over us. Telling other people that narrows your perception and perpetuates the ideology and control of it. That's a cop out for people who don't see the true issue. It's in people. People don't see equality with others. They see no reason to be compassionate or perceptive of others feelings and opinions. You can't truly find middle ground or understanding of others without proper communication. That's what people lack nowadays. It's not a societal brainwashing XD",2022-06-13T20:17:39Z,13,
briansupermega,"@Zen Raloc I feel like if you can'T recognize that most women are treated more favourably than most men when it comes to expressing intimate emotional expression, you are living in a different world.

briansupermega,@Christian Wallace Are we admitted women are called emotional or weak when they are crying like women do?,2022-06-13T19:49:43Z,0,
Zen Raloc,"@Christian Wallace Thats a little bit hypocritical. But That's exactly why I gave a generalization, because you already gave a generalization. (What you replied with wasn't even technically a full english sentence) statement Glad you could recognize the cycle.
So your opinion differs from mine. This hopefully in your case is due to experience because mine is based off of what I've frequently observed. Women get validated by men plenty, (although not enough, just like you think men don't get validated) even ones that are called simps for it while some of those simps are actually being genuine and not supporting them just out of attraction. (Those are merely examples of online platforms supporting the evidence of men validating woman)
You can't count the men who aren't actually validated their emotions genuinely either. Cause there are plenty who don't. But pretend to.
Stereotypically, women just don't pretend to validate a man's emotion (online for example) because they don't think there is something to gain.
But there's plenty of genuine people from both genders. We just need the majority of people to be like that.
Stop trying to make play this woe is us guys, woman get treated better contrarian BS card

Men on the other hand get validated and heard all the time. Maybe not most of the time but we aren't debating that. You are stating and absolute (definitive) opinion as if it's a fact. And that's just something that doesn't work. It's incorrect. It's that kind of thinking that is why men are subjected to toxic masculinity. So while you think you're in support of men getting heard emotionally, you're actually suppressing it more with the misogynistic idea that woman get treated better in this topic. That's just not true.
That's like me saying ""men don't get emotionally validated because they aren't in control of their emotions""",2022-06-13T19:29:20Z,9,

There 4 wives didnt even love him enough to stay with him and yes this guy claims he knows all.

Yes women do struggle but a lot of feminism tend to forget that men are hurt and have feelings too ans thats why redpill MRM was created to protect men by scandals that women or society have put on to them.

Take a look at johnny depp, how easy it is to be falsely claimed by a women like amber heard to accuse men of abuse.
