Gvane Pely,"Yo I can contest this view. The cause of the endocrine disruption of modern day and age are not phytoestrogens, we've been exposed to those for the whole history of humanity, they're present in all plants not just soy. The cause are synthetic disruptors like BPA. I can explain the mechanism scientifically, educate the public and provide sources for everything. I don't do Youtube usually but this is important enough. If you're interested for collab let me know.",2022-09-09T07:02:50Z,0,

You are the revolution!
A bit of advice when you debate… Don’t use phrase like “don’t you think” then follow up with “why not”
When you use this phrase, you already lost in the eyes of the viewers regardless if your statement is true or not.
What you have done is give the respondent an opportunity for a statement which could be BS but that doesn’t matter!!",2022-09-07T17:23:23Z,0,

I'm glad I got married to a real man who doesn't whine or complain all the time or type trash to a female and not have the balls to say a female in real life or even have the balls to talk to one. They cry over the stupidest thing. They start watching chicks flicks now and cry over it if you don't agree with them or feel sorry for them if they cry over it. My man don't watch chick flicks he likes action movies. He dosent whine or complain or cry over a chick flick movie if he decides to watch. Lol but he never will watch.

N Corp,I'm anti-woke and pro-soy. I had a family member get sick and started deep researching anti-cancer diets. Soy is a good anti-cancer and pro-immunity food. The phytoestrogen in soy actually counters human estrogen...that's why studies on women with breast cancer who consumed the most soy had higher survival rates. It blocks the actual estrogen. It also is associated with lower levels of ED and impotence.,2022-09-12T12:55:48Z,5,4

You can tell that in nearly every video except this one. It always comes out when he's sitting there and talking by himself. ""I live rent free in these peoples head! I win every debate within three sentences! They can't stop me! I'm better than them!"" not the exact words of Sneako but close. I think he makes great points and does win majority of his debates, which I also think is why many people won't debate him because they're scared of being fucked up the ass by him, but again he let it get to his head. Which is a shame because when people get arrogant it is usually the beginning of that mans downfall. Now for my second point. Sneako approaches the topic of women a lot better than Andrew, and I mean A LOT better. Andrew, as we all know, is very forward with the subject and is often times hypocritical, like the times he has said ""Oh yeah my girl cant cheat, that's haram, but I can because you think guys always fucked just one chick? Nahhh"". There are studies proving that girls would sleep around in ancient cultures and even in caveman times, but go off ig Andrew, all ya doin is going to ruin ya public image more. In my opinion Sneako thinks more of women, and is a lot more fair to them. Rightfully so. Keep that up my guy, cause we know that is what killed Andrew.",2022-09-11T17:05:37Z,0,0

*redacted*,"@djbabyboi   ""that's a result of toxic masculinity"" that's a result of toxic society and culture . Call it whatever you want but labeling it as a form of masculinity whether good or bad is intellectually lazy. It's like saying ""this man is honest and truthfull, he shows signs of positive masculinity"" as if these two traits are inherently masculine. How can you give it the label of masculinity when it has NOTHING to do with masculinity?

 Let me break it down for you a little more. What you're basically doing is you're mixing up culture and sociology with natural inherent male and female characteristics. YOU have a problem with values that are considered ""traditional"" in your society. This is what I was  talking about earlier, it's very common and ""traditional"" to @buse women where I live(perpetuators don't even go to jail or receive societal back lash) but this tradition is not inherently masculine. It's in fact far away from it. Call it toxic traditions if you want. And you also looked like the type to describe anything traditional as toxic so traditional masculinity and femininty is toxic to you.. 
Are you male or female btw ?

Im guessing tradfems are women who prescribe to natural gender roles, right?  Are you saying that women who dont presecribe to a yt, modern and western lifestyle are ""toxic"" fems?
Or when you say ""toxic fem"" you meant showing excessive amount of feminine characteristics ? Like being overtly ""emotional"" ?  what you got wrong is that you're mixing ""negative"" culture norms with negative stereotypes of natural male and female characteristics. The reason I disagree with you is that you're definition is half baked. So called toxic masculinity is showing excessive inherent masculine traits for eg being too detached from your emotions. Spousal @buse is not toxic masculinity because there's nothing masculine about a man h1t t1ng a woman. Where as so called toxic femininity is showing excessive inherent feminine traits like showing unnecessary amounts of emotion. But choosing to stay home to take care of kids is not.",2022-09-12T21:29:05Z,0,
djbabyboi,"@*redacted* how tf did you miss every point all at once? Masculinity and toxic masculinity are not the same thing even remotely, you're literally talking about men being shamed for being too masculine or not masculine enough, *that's a result of toxic masculinity* . And yes, toxic femininity does exist. No, they're not the same thing as just being jerks. No one has ever been shamed for just being a man.

What you have to realize is that the term ""toxic masculinity"" is not calling masculinity toxic, it's a term for toxicity that is displayed through enforcing traditionally masculine stereotypes, and if you wanna learn more about toxic femininity, I would suggest looking up tradfems",2022-09-12T20:33:31Z,0,
*redacted*,"@djbabyboi    but who's fault is that? Men are constantly policed for being too masculine or for not being masculine enough. And it's not just men it's society as a whole. There's a trend where people would think about all the negative traits they can imagine in a person and then say that these negative traits are masculine traits or ""toxic masculine"" traits. Or that this person is acting like xyz because he is male. No, these negative traits are just the characteristics of a jerk. It is that simple. No need to try to overtly analyze the situation and create new words and definitions. Back in the way we would just call them jerks. Women can be as judgmental and as toxic as men but we don't have so called ""toxic femininity"". Because it doesn't make sense to blame negative traits of a person on the gender. So if I as a female show toxic traits like being ""judgmental"" of ""unique clothes"" or gay people am I displaying ""toxic masculinity""? There's no toxic masculinity or femininity. There are only @$$holes.
There's a dangerous trend in the west where men are constantly shamed for being men. This is creating a generation of men who are afraid to be men and what worries me is that this disease might spread across the globe. Western culture is toxic and infectious.
So like I said there's masculinity and femininity. There are toxic men and toxic women. Two different things. In middle Eastern countries it is normal for a man to put a woman ""in her place"" (@buse) but violence towards woman is not associated with masculinity. It's in fact the opposite. It's in men's nature to be protective of women. But some people are jerks and they don't have this protective male nature. You can't blame masculinity for the actions that are a result of lack of masculinity.",2022-09-12T19:24:13Z,0,
djbabyboi,"@*redacted* well toxic masculinity goes hand in hand with pseudo masculinity and fragile masculinity, it stems from men being afraid to not be seen as manly enough which makes them value appearing masculine more than actually being masculine.

Examples of toxic masculinity would be men insulting other men who they think aren't ""masculine"" enough, homophohia, sometimes domestic abuse, hating on unique clothing styles etc. It's surprisingly common actually, especially in modern day teenagers, mostly like 14 yr olds",2022-09-12T18:49:19Z,0,

If you have to shout and interrupt people to make a barely half-assed point at best, it reveals your weakness and insecurity; not to mention your obscene ego that you have to scream at people to satisfy your ego and cover up your insecurities. 
It reminds me of toy breed dogs in a dog pack; they can't do jack shit besides riling up the rest of the pack.
BTW Sneako there's no evidence whatsoever that microwaves affect food, you need to stop believing all the Old Wives Tales you hear from old ladies at the nursing home.

30 related studies involving over 900 men. The researchers concluded that “neither soy foods nor isoflavone supplements alter measures of bioavailable [testosterone] concentrations in men.”

Building on this study’s findings, another analysis was published by the journal Reproductive Toxicology in 2021. For this paper, researchers examined 41 studies published from 2010 to April 2020. Over 1,700 men participated in these studies. The authors did not find any link between soy consumption and testosterone levels""

Anton Allen,"Correlation is not causation though… There are plenty of Asian cultures that have masculine men, but they have soy in their diet.

Anton Allen,"@Everything Left Turns yeah, you’re absolutely right. A Japanese breakfast for instance, other than the 5-6 small cubes of tofu in your miso soup (you could easily substitute that for a different variety), everything else is fermented or pickled.

All I'm saying is that studies show it has a negative effect on male animals (rats and mice too). Rats, mice, and monkeys are similar to humans which is why they have labs where they test things on rats such as addictions etc (similar organs and behaviors). So if I were a man I'd simply take caution lol.

It makes way more sense to be concerned about dairy consumption than soy consumption. Hence, the vegan response to ""soy boy"" being ""dairy fairy"".",2022-09-07T17:15:55Z,6,16
Drew Mason,"@IM26C4U Why are you still talking about Asians as a race? And in the US? This is about soy consumption.

I highly doubt most in the scientific community think soy lowers testosterone in human men since the human data does not support it.

And if you're not talking about the meme then what are you talking about? It's not a debunk of any kind. I understood what you're saying, I'm merely criticising the relevance.",2022-09-08T23:21:06Z,0,
Drew Mason,"@IM26C4U I'm not talking nonsense on Asian men, I literally stated things that are factually true.

If you want to make the claim that men in Asia are significantly more feminine than men in the west, as evidence that soy feminises men, then you need to provide EVIDENCE for that.

Talking about how WESTERN PEOPLE think Asian men IN THE WEST are more feminine, is NOT evidence of anything.",2022-09-08T18:00:32Z,0,
Drew Mason,"@IM26C4U I'm not in my feelings at all, my responses have been perfectly rational.

I said that the meme that soy feminises men was based on a human case study, and you countered that it was to do with animal studies.

There being animal studies does NOT prove that the meme originated from them. I was asking how you heard about the animal studies to see if it's some basis for the meme and not just your personal experience of soy + feminisation.",2022-09-08T17:58:22Z,0,
IM26C4U,"@Drew Mason  OMmL 🤣🤣 get your feelings out of this. I had a psychology teacher that worked on rats, mice and other animals that are similar to us humans. If you took 3 seconds to actually look up data on the effects on soy then animals studies would show up everytime on any search site. Rats, mice and monkeys are similar to us so yes they get studied on everytime.

Stop talking nonsense on asain men, they're not seen as masculine at large, but meek. Ig all men are masculine in your worldview because, ""... men are masculine from the fact that they are men and not women."" The soy you're consuming is getting to your head rn jk jk. Keep eating and drinking your soy, it's fine. Fyi asain men are considered competitive when it comes to education and that's all. Clearly you see any possible con on consuming soy as ""misinformation"" so keep drinking your soy, I only responded just so others can see especially since you said asains are seen as masculine (not by women or most men tho).",2022-09-08T17:42:18Z,1,
Drew Mason,"@IM26C4U I'm getting that Asian men are masculine from the fact that they are men and not women. 

Where's the evidence that men in Asia are significantly less masculine than in the West? 

Because when I look at the CCP, the existence of strong hierarchies, of parents instilling competitiveness in their children, of comparable violent crime, of martial arts culture, these are all masculine derived traits. I don't obviously see a counter that makes Asian's significantly less masculine than non-Asians, as evidence that soy feminises men.",2022-09-08T17:28:10Z,0,
Drew Mason,"@IM26C4U But why rely on animal studies when there have been human studies on soy for a long time?

I'm curious where you heard about the animal studies. Most people don't browse pubmed or whatever.

Ask a Western Woman? About people in Asia? I already clarified I was not referring to the Asian race, but to the geographical demographic that consume more soy than the West. This is about soy, not race. What has penis size got to do with anything? Unless you're implying that soy is responsible for small Asian penises.",2022-09-08T17:26:22Z,0,
IM26C4U,"@Drew Mason Scientist decided to question it's benefits and they concluded,  after the animal studies, they might have negative effects on men as well. Rats, mice, and monkeys have similar organs and share similar behaviors as us (they studied the prolonged affects of soy on these animals). There's many studies that state soy is healthy for the organs (except thyroid), but not so great for men when it's comes to the way it makes them behave if that makes any sense. 

I never said ask Asain women, I said ask any women. I'm a women and I'm telling you right now not many women can claim asain men are masculine especially compared to other men of other races/ ethnicities... it's common sense... they're not seen as masculine... just traditional. Why do you think people make the stereotype asain men aren't well endowed down there? Idk where you getting asain men are masculine from...",2022-09-07T23:36:07Z,0,
Drew Mason,"@IM26C4U I never heard of that one. I was in the online vegan spaces when the meme was incepted and it was always a reference to human case studies, not animal studies.

I don't live in Asia, so I can't ask Asian women. I wasn't referring to Asians as a race, but as a geographical demographic: A group that eats more soy.

Drew Mason,"As others have pointed out in the comments, Asians consume the most soy yet their men aren't more feminine. Poor diet and inactivity is likely the reason for a decline in testosterone. You can think of hormones like a muscle, they produce when they are stimulated and fed. Working out stimulates the muscles and thus stimulate the hormonal system since hormones are utilised for growth, and nutrients act as the physical precursor for muscle mass as they do for hormones.",2022-09-07T17:33:43Z,2,

Jeem Apologetics,"It's the absence of religion mainly, and the dilution of religion and culture. Countries can still maintain masculinity and tradition if they are irreligious as long as there is a strong, unifying culture like in China (china has its own problems on account of state-enforced atheism but manliness is not one of them yet). In the West, people have been taught to hate themselves, hate their ancestry, reject all forms of tradition, and have been pushed to the side by feminists who walk all over weak men. Those same weak men think obeying feminists will get them rewards, either from women or from the state. If you think America is bad, take a look at Western Europe particularly Northern Europe. Absolutely disgusting level of effeminate men there, they have 0 backbone, 0 red blood, nothing, it's a disgrace. Men need something to fight for or defend. If it isn't God, then it must be a nation. If you have neither, it's over. When men have nothing to fight for or defend, they don't need to be warriors. When men can be weak and thrive in a weak society, they will stay weak. Go look at the map chart for Europeans who would fight for their homeland. There's a severe contrast between West (who hates itself) and East (who is restoring traditional orthodox christianity and slavic culture). it's sad",2022-09-07T16:18:47Z,0,0

Calmsine,"@catindacorner this is what hurts the red pill movement. I’ve been following a lot of it and the basic non sexist consensus I’ve found is that it’s about getting more options in dating when you’re a man. It’s about being the exception rather than finding it. I have a hot gf who I vibe very well with, but it took a LONG ass time to get her man. Im 6’4 and been told I’m good looking, 4 years of chasing before I found someone who met my standards. But now if I lose her, that’s another 4 years out of my life of chasing. Being a high value man is more than just being rich. It’s being the full package, being the 1% of men out there. Obviously not everyone is going to make it, but that’s the catch. If everyone made it, it doesn’t work because that minority of men becomes the majority, which means less demand. I’d argue it actually allows men to be themselves because if the girl doesn’t like how a dude expresses himself, while he’s being respectful, he can have more options to choose from once she leaves. I used to have NO standards for women but it made me depressed which is why I’m picky now.",2022-09-10T19:05:24Z,0,
Calmsine,@Troy The Grind Never Stops i eat tofu everyday because it’s cheaper than fake ass tasting meat as a substitute. A block a day. All poor vegans who try to save money eat this way.,2022-09-10T18:42:18Z,0,
Calmsine,"@Troy The Grind Never Stops Is English your first language? Genuine question because maybe you’re not expressing yourself correctly. And also soy does have estrogen but it has PHYTOestrogen which is for PLANTS. If you weren’t such a bot you’d know this. Consumed in large amounts it could have an effect, but we’re talking 10k calories a day of just soy, nothing else. Your average normie ain’t eating that much to begin with. And if they are it’s because their diet contains a fuck ton of oil and fat because it’s calorically dense. If you actually looked at the data you’d know this and realize lifestyle is a huge contributor. Don’t believe me? Look up right wing vegans, lots of them share their testosterone levels and they also workout. I can give you credible data too.",2022-09-10T18:37:51Z,0,

paladin maguire of BOS,"@Giovinco Maz Patrick isn't a hater though. He just disagrees with him on a lot. You don't have to agree with someone like sneako to enjoy their content or feel entertained. I disagree with his views on women, but I don't sit here saying he's pathetic or anything. I respect him for speaking his mind. It's what I do. It's what more people should do.",2022-09-09T13:01:26Z,0,
ruji,"@Giovinco Maz Patrick isn't a hater at all, he pushed a narrative in his video to appeal to a wider audience is all. Both are great content creators I hope some form of collab could happen at some point",2022-09-07T18:41:01Z,3,
